title: "How to Edit, Remove or Recall Skype messages that you've sent"

This Skype functionality comes in handy if you've made a typing error or if you've send the wrong message to the wrong person.

NOTE: If your recipient uses a Linux version of Skype and you a Windows version of Skype this functionality unfortunately won't work at present (when this article got written).

- Right click on the message
- Select **Edit message** to modify message or **Remove message** to delete the message.
- Confirm the action
- Finished

NOTE: Removed message won’t be completely deleted and hidden from view. Although the recipients are no longer able to see what’s the actual content of the message, they will still see a post message with text reading as “**The host has deleted the message**”. Secondly, only recent transmitted and sent message can be modified or recalled, the trick won’t work on messages older than one hour.
