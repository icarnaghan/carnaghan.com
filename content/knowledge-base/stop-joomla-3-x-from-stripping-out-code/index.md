Joomla! has this option called **Turn Off Filtering** when editing content which in short means that text won't get filtered for a specific user group if turned off.

To **Turn Off Filtering** follow the steps below:

1. Click on **System -> Global Configuration** **![](images/P+TYAIn9Qxi5AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)
    
    **
2. Click on the **Text Filters** tab

3. Set **No Filtering** next to the User Group where text filtering should be disabled.

4. Click on **SAVE.** Now when a user within the **No Filtering** group ads some content, no Text Filters will get applied.
