**GDM** = GNOME Display Manager

You may need to **restart** **GDM** if **GDM** halts or does not want to function anymore.

If a similar problem like this occurs it usually means that only **GDM** does not function.

 

 

If you quickly want to **restart** **GDM** press the following key combinations together: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace

To restart **GDM** via the **Terminal** **session** type in the following command: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
