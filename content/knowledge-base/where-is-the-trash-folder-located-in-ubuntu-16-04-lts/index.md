The trash folder can be found at:

```
/home/username/.local/share/Trash
```

Replace **username** with your username.

The trash folder can also be accessed using the Graphical User Interface by opening the **File Manager**.

Once opened, press the key combination **CTRL+H** to view all hidden files and folders.

Open the **.local** folder, then the **share** folder and then finally the **Trash** folder.
