**NOTE**: This can only be done withing **iTunes**  _'Tested in iTunes 10'_

**Answer**:

- Open **iTunes** and plugin your **iPhone** 
- On the left hand side under **DEVICES** you will see your device, click on it to select it and then click on it again to rename it, similar to renaming files and folders in **Windows
