This error occurs when you have the **Custom, stockable variants** plugin in **VirtueMart 2.0** enabled for one of the products or all the products on the page where you get the error.

In order to fix this, you will need to remove this plugin from the product/s where the product does not make use of this plugin or does not have any variants/child products assigned to the **Custom, stockable variants plugin.**
