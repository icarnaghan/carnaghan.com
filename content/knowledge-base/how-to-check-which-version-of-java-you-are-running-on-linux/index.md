1. Open a new Terminal Window
2. Type in the command
    
    ```
    java -version
    ```
    
3. The output should look similar to the below:
    
    ```
    java version "1.7.0_95"
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.6.4) (7u95-2.6.4-3)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.95-b01, mixed mode)
    ```
    
    The above code indicates that you are running Java SDK version 7 on your server
