- Open a new Terminal Window and locate to your Home Directory
    
    ```
    cd /home/YOURNAME
    ```
    
- Rename the **.mozilla** folder to **.mozilla\_old** or anything you prefer
    
    ```
    mv .mozilla .mozilla_old
    ```
    
- Restart Firefox and problem solved.

**NOTE**: Always make a backup of the **.mozilla** folder to avoid data loss
