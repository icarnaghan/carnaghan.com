Execute the following command

```
tar -zxvf archive.tar.gz
```

This command will extract the contents of the archive.tar.gz file in the current directory

 

The options _**\-zxvf**_ mean the following

_**\-z**_ = filter the archive through gzip _**\-x**_ = extract files from an archive _**\-v**_ = verbose **_\-f_**  = use archive file or device ARCHIVE
