Woke up one morning and my iPhone 4 was dead, I tried holding in the power button, charged the phone and nothing happened, did not even make a sound or showed the apple logo. Although the previous night the battery was still 77% charged, but the phone just was dead, luckily I managed to get it on again

**Answer**:

- Hold the **Power Button** and the **Home Button** together for between **15 and 30 seconds**, you notice the **Apple logo** will appear and the **iPhone 4** will switch on.
- If the **iPhone4** keeps on going off, try the above solution again and then Go to **Settings**\->**Reset**\->**Reset All Settings** _(**NOTE:** This will reset all your settings to factory defaults, but won't delete any data, I suggest before doing anything you are unsure about backup your iPhone 4)_
- The last thing to try before going to the **Apple Store** is to do a **Factory Restore** from **ITunes**
