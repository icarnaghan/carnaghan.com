What happens if you have accidently deleted the Top Menu or Any other Menu for your site and need to have it restored.

**STEP 1**

In the **Joomla! Administrator (www.yoursite.com/administrator)**, select **Extensions->Module Manager** now the **Module Manager** appears.

**STEP 2**

Click on the **NEW** button to create a new **Module** for your site that you need to have in our case we are going to select the **Menu Module** called **Menu** and click on **Next** and then give it a **name** (Joomla! will ID this menu with the name)(Don't use any spaces in this name and make sure that it is a unique name.) and set the **parameters** as you want it to appear. **Important is that you specify the Menu Class Suffix to "-icon" (Under Parameters)(Remember that this may differ from template to template) for the top menu and that you select the correct Module Position for the Top Menu eg. top.** otherwise the top menu won't display correctly and then click on **SAVE**and publish the new menu in the **Module Manager** and it should now appear.
