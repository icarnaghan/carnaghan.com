I'm using **Ubuntu** **9.04** and needed to have the **RIGHT CLICK OPEN IN TERMINAL** option enabled. eg. If you need to work in the desktop directory via the terminal and you don't want to navigate to the directory via typing this application will come in handy.  To enable/install this follow the steps below.

**STEP 1**

Make sure you are connected to the Internet

**STEP 2**

Open the terminal

**STEP 3**

Type the following command **sudo aptitude install nautilus-open-terminal** and press enter

**STEP 4**

Enter you're password

**STEP 5**

Reboot you're machine and everything should work.
