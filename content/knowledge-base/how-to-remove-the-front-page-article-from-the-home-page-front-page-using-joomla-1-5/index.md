**STEP 1**

Go to your **Joomla! 1.5 Administration (Backend)** eg. www.yoursite.com/administrator and login with your username and password

**STEP 2**

Click on **Content -> Article Manager**

**STEP 3**

No you'll see all your **Articles** listed, you'll see the title **Front Page** and underneath that you'll find there is either an **Red Cross** or **Green Check Mark** next to the **Articles**, if there is a **Green Check Mark** it means that the **Article** will be displayed on the **Front Page**. Click on the **Check Mark** and then you'll notice it will turn into a **Red Cross** which means it's not displaying on the **Front Page**.

Alternatively you can also click on **Content -> Front Page Manager** and then under the title **Published** you'll notice a **Content Icon with a Check Mark** on it next to the **Article**. Click on it to have it **unpublished** and now it won't appear on the **Front Page**.
