**The following are the requirements for an e-mail address:**

- An e-mail address consists of local part and domain separated by an at sign (@) character.

- The local part may consist of alphabetic and numeric characters, and the following characters: !, #, $, %, &, ', \*, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, \_, \`, {, |, } and ~, possibly with dot separators (.), inside, but not at the start, end or next to another dot separator.

- The local part may consist of a quoted stringâ€”that is, anything within quotes ("), including spaces.

- Quoted pairs (such as \\@) are valid components of a local part.

- The maximum length of a local part is 64 characters.

- A domain consists of labels separated by dot separators.

- Domain labels start with an alphabetic character followed by zero or more alphabetic characters, numeric characters or the hyphen (-), ending with an alphabetic or numeric character.

- The maximum length of a label is 63 characters.

- The maximum length of a domain is 255 characters.

- The domain must be fully qualified and resolvable to a type A or type MX DNS address record.
