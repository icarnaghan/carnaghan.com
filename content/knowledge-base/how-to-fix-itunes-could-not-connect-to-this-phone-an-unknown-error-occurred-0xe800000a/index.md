**Error**: _itunes could not connect to this phone. an unknown error occurred (0xE800000A)_ when connecting your **iPhone 4** to **iTunes** on **Windows 7**?

**Solution**:

1. On **Windows 7** locate **c:\\Program Data\\Apple\\Lockdown**
2. There should be two files in the folder, delete these two files, reconnect your **iPhone** to **iTunes** and it will appear again without any errors
