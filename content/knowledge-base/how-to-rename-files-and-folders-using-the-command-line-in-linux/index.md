We accomplish this by using the "**mv**" (move command)

**Example:**

File Example: {codecitation class="brush: bash;"}mv old\_file new\_file{/codecitation}

Directory Example: {codecitation class="brush: bash;"}mv old\_directory new\_directory{/codecitation}

**NOTE**:

- **mv** can move several files into a destination folder, or a single file.
- **mv** renaming will contain the original attributes of the file or directory and also the creation date of the original file or folder
