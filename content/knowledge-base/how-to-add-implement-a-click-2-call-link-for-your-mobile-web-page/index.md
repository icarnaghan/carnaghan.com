If you have a mobile website and you need to add a click to call link this method could come in handy.If a visitor clicks on this link his mobile phone will prompt the user if he wants to phone the number specified.

Add the following anchor tag to your code

```
<a href="tel:1111111111">1111111111</a>
```

Replace the 1's with the correct number, please do not include any other characters or the + sign after **tel:** between the brackets, otherwise it won't work.
