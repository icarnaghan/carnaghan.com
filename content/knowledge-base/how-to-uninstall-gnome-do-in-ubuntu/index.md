- Open a new **Terminal Window**
- Type in the following command and press enter
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get autoremove gnome-do
    ```
    
- This will remove **gnome-do** and all dependencies

**Definition**: autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.
