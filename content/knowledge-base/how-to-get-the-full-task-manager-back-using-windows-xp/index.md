The **Task Manager** has disappeared and I can only see the **performance** view, there are no other tabs visible, can only see a **minimized** version of the **Task Manager**.

**Answer**:

- Double click on the border of the minimized **Task Manager**, this will bring back the **Full Task Manager.
    
    **![Restore Minimized Task Manager](images/taskmgr1.png "Restore Minimized Task Manager")
- If this does not work you could cycle through the **Task Manager** tabs by pressing **CTRL+TAB** continuously.
