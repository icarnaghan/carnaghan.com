If you have **Virtuemart** installed on your **Joomla! installation** and you need to customize the **confirmation Email**, you need to have some basic knowledge of **FTP**(Except if you are working on the localhost) and **HTML**. Lets get started by this step-by-step instructions.

**STEP 1**

Connect to your website via **FTP** or access your files on your PC locally usually in the **HTDOCS** folder if you have **Apache** installed. This can only be done if you have access to those files.

**STEP 2**

Follow the below path in the **root** folder of your **Joomla! installation.**

**administrator\\components\\administrator\\components\\com\_virtuemart\\html\\templates\\order\_email**

or

**administrator\\components\\com\_virtuemart\\html\\templates**

**STEP 3**

Locate the filename with the default language of your **Virtuemart** Installation with the **php** file extension, open the file and edit the HTML to fit your needs. That's all and now you should be able to edit your **Virtuemart** confirmation emails.
