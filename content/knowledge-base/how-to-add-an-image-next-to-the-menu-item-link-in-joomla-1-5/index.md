If you need to add an **Image Icon** or **Image** next to your Menu Item in Joomla! 1.5 then this Tutorial is for you.

**STEP 1**

Log into the back end. Once in the backed of your Joomla! site eg. (www.yoursite.com/administrator) select **MENUS=>MAIN MENU** (Any menu you prefer). The **Menu Item Manager** should open now.

**STEP 2**

Click on a **Menu Item** to **edit**, or make a check in the **checkbox** next to the **item** that you wish to **edit** and click on the **Edit button**.

**STEP 3**

The **Menu items settings** should appear. On the right hand side of the screen open the **Parameters-System option**, if you click on it it should expand. Look for a setting called **Menu Image with a Drop down** next to it. Select the image that you need to have as the **Menu Link** and click on **Save**.

Now an image should appear next to your Menu Text.

**NOTE:** If the image that you need to use isn't in the list you need to add it manually.

1) Click on SITE=>**MEDIA MANAGER**

![Example1](images/mediamanager1.jpg "Example1")

2) Upload your Images to the **STORIES** directory or via FTP upload you images to the **Root Directory** of your Joomla! Installation in the directory **IMAGES/STORIES**.

Are you able to select the image, but on the website it does not display the image?

If that\\'s the case it could be related to your template

Thanks for the HOWTO - I posted the question, about how to add an image to a menu item, on the Joomla forum but never got an answer.

The image is added, but next challenge is lower it a bit - the bottom of the image is aligned with the centre-line of the text height.
