title: "How to disable ASUS Express Gate Cloud"

I recently had a **Asus Netbook 1015b** to work on and everytime I boot it up the **ASUS Express Gate Cloud** came up and I needed to remove it since I don't use it.

This is what I did to remove it

1. On **Boot** I pressed **F2** immediately when **promted** to enter the **Bios**
2. Under the **Boot menu** **item** I found that **Express Gate** was **Enabled**, I pressed the **minus (-)** key to disable it. And then **F10** to **save** and exit.
3. Immediately after **Boot** it was gone and I was happy
