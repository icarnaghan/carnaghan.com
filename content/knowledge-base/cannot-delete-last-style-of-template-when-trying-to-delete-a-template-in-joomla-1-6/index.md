1. To remove a template you will have to click on _**Extensions**_ and then _**Extention Manager**_
2. Click on the **Manage** tab
3. Search for your template "_Filter by Type and select Template to make things easier_"
4. Check the **checkbox** next to your Template and click on the **Uninstall** **button** at the **top right corner**
5. The Template will now uninstall

**NOTE**:

If it says that the template has been uninstalled and you still see your Template in the template Styles or you still get the error when you try to remove, you will have to remove them manually within the **jos\_template\_styles** table in your database.
