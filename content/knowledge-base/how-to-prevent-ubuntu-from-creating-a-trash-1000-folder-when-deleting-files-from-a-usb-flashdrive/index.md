- Don't use the **delete** button only _(Otherwise the **.Trash-1000** folder will be created)_
- Press the key combination **shift+delete** together to delete then **Ubuntu** won't create a **.Trash-1000** folder. _(Note: If you delete files and folders this way they are gone forever!)_

**NOTE**: This has been tested on **Ubuntu 9.04**.
