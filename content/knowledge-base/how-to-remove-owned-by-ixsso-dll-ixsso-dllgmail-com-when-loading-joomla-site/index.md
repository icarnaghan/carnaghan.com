What do you do when you open your **Joomla! website** and the site is replaced by **Owned by ixsso.dll**, **ixsso.dll@gmail.com**, now the Question is how to remove **Owned by ixsso.dll , ixsso.dll@gmail.com** or how to repair **Owned by ixsso.dll**, **ixsso.dll@gmail.com**.

 

**Owned by ixsso.dll**

**ixsso.dll@gmail.com**

**STEP 1**

This means that your site has been hacked. Hopefully you have a **Backup** of your entire Joomla! site. Locate your **FTP details** and **login** to your Site via FTP. In the **root directory** locate the **index.php** file and replace it with the **index.php** file from your **Backup** of your **Joomla!** site. If you don't have a **Backup** (**_Please always have a Backup ready!_**) of your **Joomla! site**, find out exactly what version of **Joomla!** you have or had. eg. **Joomla! 1.5.3 or Joomla! 1.0.13**. Download the complete **Joomla! installation package** from www.joomla.org (Remember to download the same version that you used for the site that was being hacked). Extract the Joomla! installation, replace the **index.php** file of your site with the **index.php** file from the **Joomla! installation** that you have just exstracted. Now your site should work again as ussual.
