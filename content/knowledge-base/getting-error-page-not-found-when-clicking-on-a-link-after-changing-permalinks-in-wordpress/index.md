title: "Getting Error Page not Found when clicking on a link after changing Permalinks in Wordpress"

We recently installed the Wordpress Ecommerce plugin and created a page that links to a specific product, what we did we changed the Permalink of this specific product and then when viewing the product we got an error that the Page can't be found or more specific we got the message _**"This is somewhat embarrassing, isn’t it? It seems we can’t find what you’re looking for. Perhaps searching, or one of the links below, can help. "**_

**Solution**:

In the **Wordpress Admin** go to **Settings->Permalinks** and click on **Save**. This will **update** all **permalinks** and all will work fine again
