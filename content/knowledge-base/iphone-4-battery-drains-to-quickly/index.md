This I've noticed happened to my **IPhone** just after coming back from Holiday in another country. What I did while I was away is, I switched the **Date and Time** on the phone to set the **Time Zone automatically**. Soon after that I've noticed that the battery life drains quickly from 90% to 10% in just a couple of hours. A couple of Days ago I've updated to _**iOS 5.1**_ so I'm sure it's a bug in **iOS 5**

After turning the feature off that automatically sets the Time Zone, my battery did not drain that quickly anymore although the entire draining issue is not solved it did help a bit.

To turn the feature off do the following

1. Press _**Settings->General->Date & Time**_
2. Flip _**Set Automatically**_ from _**On**_ to _**Off**_

Also do the following

1. Press _**Settings->Location Services->System Services**_
2. Flip the **_Setting Time Zone_** to off.

Once all is done drain your Battery up untill 3% and do a Full Cycle Recharge and turn the Phone off.
