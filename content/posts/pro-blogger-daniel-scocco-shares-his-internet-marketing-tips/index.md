There are millions, maybe even billions of different blogs on the internet, with new blogs being created every minute. Blogging is still a relatively new realm to the internet, and people are just started to discover it's power-first hand. Daniel Scocco, the creator and main blogger on the site Daily Blog Tips runs a few very popular blogs on the web. Some could call him a professional blogger, an internet marketer, or even a social media guru.

I got a chance to get an interview with Daniel about his popular blogging tips site. I got the inside scoop on how the blog was made, monetization, and even some words of advice for all the new bloggers out there looking to make a full-time income through blogging. Anybody looking to get the inside scoop about making money online through blogging, check out what Daniel's got to say below.

#### What is the main idea behind Daily Blog Tips? How did you get the idea for creating the blog?

I started creating my first blogs and websites back in 2005. In 2006, so around one year later, I was already having some success with them, which led me to quit my job and start working full time with my online projects. I created Daily Blog Tips to share the tips and tricks I was learning with my other websites.

#### What were some of your major influences that got you interested in blogging?

![ProBlogger Icon](images/problogger-icon.jpg "ProBlogger Logo") There are two of them. The first one was Steve Pavlina. I was already experimenting with HTML websites before coming across him, but it was after reading his blog that I decided to explore the blog format and to start using WordPress.

The second one is Darren Rowse. I discovered his Problogger website after a while, and it helped me tremendously in the early days, because he was always experimenting with new things and sharing it on the blog.

#### How much traffic does Daily Blog Tips get, on average? How have you seen this grow since first launching the site?

The blog gets around 300,000 monthly page views (according to the number of AdSense impressions, which I think is pretty accurate). I would say that the traffic grew gradually over the years. There were a couple of spikes here and there, but the overall growth trend was pretty linear.

#### I see that you have about 25,000 RSS subscribers on Daily Blog Tips. Do you think RSS is still the best way to syndicate your newest posts, or do you market in different ways?

I believe having an RSS feed (with the email delivery option) is still essential to any blog (and to any website that gets updated frequently).

That being said, we need to evolve along with the Web, and that means adopting new content distribution models as they emerge. One of them is Twitter. It started as a microblogging and messaging tool, but today it works as a content distribution platform as well. Practically speaking, make sure that the readers of your blog can stay updated with it via Twitter, if so they desire.

#### What are some of your favorite posts on the blog?

I wrote one recently that received a good feedback. It was titled 4 Steps to Increase Blog Traffic. From my older posts, I like 43 Web Design Mistakes You Should Avoid and 28 Ways to Make Money with Your Website.

#### Can you share with us about how much revenue the blog makes through advertising space? Is it enough to cover hosting costs, domain registration, etc?

Among my three "Daily" blogs I make enough to live by. Advertising space is only one revenue source though. There are others, like affiliate marketing.

#### What are some of your favorite blogs on the web?

There are many. Here are some that I read quite often:

\- Problogger.net - Entrepreneurs-Journey.com - QuickSprout.com - Copyblogger.com - Wolf-Howl.com

#### What advice would you give to someone looking to get started in blogging and making money online?

First of all you need to start with the right mindset, which is: creating a successful blog and making money with is possible, but it will take hard work and it won't happen overnight. For most people it can take up to two years before they start making signficant money with their websites.

Are you willing to put the hard work in and be patient for the results? If so, go for it.

Other than that, blog about something that you are passionate or knowledgeable about. The rest will follow.
