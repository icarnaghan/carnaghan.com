Sometimes, you may want to display widgets only on certain pages of a site. If you've knowledge of PHP, you can show/hide widgets with just 2 lines of codes. The 1st line will have the PHP if else condition to detect the current page or term. If the condition you've specified in the if statement is true, then the code inside the if block must be executed.

The block must have the shortcode or code to display the required widget. It is the 2nd line of our code.

Showing or hiding widget is a great technique to display related content or targeted ads to the visitor. For example, if the current post is about cheap hosting plans, you can customize the code to display posts from the current category or an ad about Bluehost or Hostgator hosting package.

If you don't know PHP, you can use the free plugin called Widget Logic to display or hide widgets.
