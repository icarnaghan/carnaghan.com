Web hosting is the backbone of a website. It is crucial to the success of a blogger, business, and the website. A poor web hosting firm will have big downtimes. Because of poor infrastructure, the network latency will be high and your site will rank below faster websites in the search engines.

Web hosting services are of three types, shared, VPS, dedicated, and cloud. The shared hosting plans are the cheapest of the three. They are ideal for small sites owned by newbie webmasters and beginners. VPS and dedicated plans are costly as compared to shared. They are suitable for business or larger websites owned by experienced webmasters. Cloud platforms are suitable for websites whose traffic may explode anytime.

### How to identify the best web hosting service?

**Uptime**: Webmasters use this metric to know how many active hours or minutes of a website were wasted because of a hosting failure. A good hosting provider will have an uptime of 99+%. The 1% downtime is due to maintenance activities at data centers, failure at DNS providers, ISP, etc.

**Support**: CPanel or Shared hosting service users are more of likely novice users or beginners using content management systems. The company that offers shared hosting plans must provide 24 x 7 support. They must offer three modes of support:

1. Phone.
2. Ticket.
3. Live chat.

If the support isn't good, no customer would recommend the service to others. VPS and Cloud providers must have good documentation for users to troubleshoot problems themselves.

**Platforms**: Hosting firms must provide support for popular languages, databases, and frameworks such as PHP, WordPress, Drupal, MySQL, etc.

**Backup and logs:** A cheap hosting provider should provide options to create website and database backups. It should also keep a record of visitors IP address.
