**Use hyperlinks instead of banners**: Amazon associates affiliate program started generated a decent income for me once i ditched the banner images and started using the direct affiliate links. I used keywords like the top, best, buy, check in the anchor text for links. For example, if I'm trying to promote Playstation 4 through my blog, I'll use the anchor text as Buy PS4 here.

**Write quality articles**: If you're serious about amazon affiliate program, make sure that you write and publish very high-quality content. If your article has 1000+ words and it features low competition keywords, your site will rank high in search engines. Thus, you'll start earning money with amazon associates.

**Don't stuff your article with affiliate links**: Some blogs were penalized by Google panda update for having too many affiliate links on a single page. Add an amazon affiliate link only if your content has at least 300 words.

**Use No-Follow attribute**: To keep your blog safe from Google penguin or panda penalty, use the rel="nofollow" attribute for every affiliate link. If you've already added tons of affiliate links, you can use the search and replace plugin to add the attribute to each link within 1 or 2 minutes.

**Experiment with link colors**: Color plays a very important role in our lives. We choose clothes on the basis of colors. In blogging, your bounce rates can reduce and affiliate commissions can increase if you experiment with link colors. The conversion rate on my tech blog increased after I change the hyperlink color from red to blue. You can try out the same.

I hope that you've found these tips useful.
