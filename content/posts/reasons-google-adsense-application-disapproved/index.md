Google AdSense program can make you rich. But getting your blog or website approved for it is a challenging task. Newbie bloggers have to wait for several months before their sites get approved for Adsense ads. I had applied for 20 times. Each time I applied for Adsense, I got the rejection message stating that my blog is not eligible to participate in the program. The news was disheartening, but it didn't stop me from submitting the application again. My site got approved on the 21st attempt.

### Google Adsense approval process

When you submit your application, Google Adsense crawler will visit your site. It will go through all posts and pages published on your blog. If it doesn’t find any content or navigation issues with your site, your blog will be manually reviewed by a Google engineer. The reviewer will check your site’s design, navigation, traffic stats, etc. If he is impressed or satisfied with your site, you’ll be accepted in AdSense program; else you’ll get a rejection email from Google. Most of the blogs get rejected in the second round. Here are the key reasons why blog gets disapproved:

**Duplicate content**: Google will never accept a blog that that features copied or scraped content. If you’ve copied an article from other site and published it on your blog, no matter how many times you apply for AdSense, your blog will never get approved. So make sure that your site is free from duplicate content. You can use tools like Copyscape or indicates to find duplicate lines, statements or paragraphs in your blog posts.

**Little traffic**: The best and the easiest way to get an approved AdSense account is to publish 3 or 4 unique and high-quality articles 3 or 4 times a week for a few months. Once your site starts getting 1000+ visitors from Google or Bing search engines, submit an AdSense application and ads will start showing on your blog.

**Low-quality content**: MFA or thin affiliate sites are never accepted as their chances of ranking high in search engines are very low.

**Relevant pages**: Privacy policy, disclaimer, about me pages and contact forms are very important. Their presence indicate that a site is trustworthy. Every popular site running on the internet have these pages. Before you submit an AdSense application, add these four pages. The contact form should have your valid email address. The privacy policy should include information on Google’s doubleclick cookie. About me, the page should contain your photograph and details on your blog.

**Poor navigation**: Navigation is one of the most important parts of a website. Top blogging platforms like WordPress or Blogger allows their users to setup dropdown or menu based navigation quickly. You don’t have to write any menu or paging code. But you may have to edit a few lines or two to customize the navigation (change color, font or menu name). Before applying for Adsense, make sure that your site has a menu bar and a paging system.

I've worked with advertising networks like Chitika, media.net, bidvertizer, eDomz. They're low paying. Media.net might pay you well provided your site gets enough traffic from United States, Australia, Europe or Canada. Thus there's no perfect alternative to Google Adsense. If your blog is being disapproved, you can signup for an affiliate program to earn money online.
