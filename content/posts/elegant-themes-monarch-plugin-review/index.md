Blogging is a type of online business. If you invest money in your WordPress site, your business will benefit from it. In WP, investment is nothing but purchasing premium themes and plugins which help in improving UX.

When it comes to plugins, the most important plugin is the one that allows visitors to share blog posts on social networks. Yes! You've guessed it right! We're talking about social media sharing plugins.

There are free plugins that add sharing buttons to your blog, but they end up the blogger in frustration. I had a horrible time with the free Flare plugin which resulted in tons of soft 404 errors on my tech site with the flare\_get\_counts admin ajax parameter. After this incident, I gave up using free social sharing plugins and bought a premium plugin.

## Review of the best Social sharing WP plugin

ElegantThemes Monarch is the god of social media sharing plugins. It is one of the best premium plugins in the world. It's 100 times better than free social media plugins for WordPress. You can download it from the official Elegant Themes website by registering a developers account on a payment of USD 89.

Monarch is beautiful, and it scales well on a large site. I've seen it running on a large WordPress website with around 200000 visitors per day.

ElegantThemes Monarch, when placed wisely will make the user share the blog posts on social networks. Its attractive design will tempt the user to click on a social media button.

Monarch can be placed at the top and bottom of the content. If your blog has empty space to the left of the post content, Monarch allows you to add floating sharing buttons in the space.

The floating buttons will be visible to the visitor without distracting him/her.

ET Monarch comes with support for around 20 social networks which includes Facebook, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter. Users are allowed to add a social network of their choice.

This plugin allows you to remove gaps between social buttons and apply animations which will be displayed when the visitor hovers his mouse over the button. It has an option of displaying social icons, network name or both.

Monarch allows button color customization, and it includes more than five amazing animation effects.

Apart from the post sidebar, bottom, and top, the plugin has the option of display share buttons on media content, as a fly-in or in a popup.

When you configure Monarch to display sharing buttons on pictures, the buttons will appear only when the user moves his mouse cursor onto the image. Visitors who like sharing images will find this function immensely useful.

The popup module will increase the chances of the posts getting shared to a great extent. Fly-in should be used when your blog doesn't boast too many widgets on the sidebar.

Fly-ins and Popups can be configured to load by user activity i.e. when the user scrolls down, reaches to the end of the article, after dropping a comment, etc. Monarch has the option of displaying the popup or fly-in when the user is not interacting with your website. This will grab his attention.
