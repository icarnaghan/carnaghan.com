Before buying any product from a website or before contacting a business, search engine users will go through the reviews. If the reviews are negative, the user may not communicate with the business or he'll leave the website without making any purchase.

Customers are the best people to judge a product and the best way to get their feedback is by adding a review section to the website. Reviews may help in improving the rankings of a website as it may have many new keywords.

Have you checked Yelp.com? In Yelp, customers are allowed to rate and review any services of their choice. This site ranks very well in the search engines. It has over 50 million unique visitors per month.

Google allows its users to rate a business page. You'll have to create a page through your Google Plus account for the same. When a user searches for your business in Google, the ratings will be displayed along the business information, contact details and address in the upper right section of the Google search engine. If you have a WordPress website, you can easily add a review form with the WP customer reviews plugin.
