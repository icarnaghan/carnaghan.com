Adsense is being used on millions of blogs, and it is a source of online income for many bloggers. Have you ever wondered how the webmasters manage to add advertisements to the best and hottest positions? Most blogs are using either WordPress or Blogger CMS.

Blogger comes with an inbuilt utility to insert ads in various popular areas, i.e., above, middle and below post content. On WordPress, you don't have to be a PHP and HTML programmer to add Google AdSense unit to your favorite position. Simply install any of the below **best Adsense plugins for WordPress** and follow its setup instructions.

### Ad Inserter

AI is the most powerful WordPress plugin. It can insert AdSense ad units between, after, at the beginning of post, sidebar or after certain paragraphs.

AI comes with support for 16 ad blocks. It can process PHP Ad codes. Ad Inserter plugin allows users to blacklist categories, tags, URLs, referrers, and post. Once you blacklist a page, AI will not insert ads in it.

If you configure AI correctly, you can prevent accidental clicks that can be a threat to your AdSense account. You can configure Ad Inserter to hide or show Ad units on the desktop, mobile devices or tablets. To detect the screen width and height, AI can employ PHP or JavaScript code.

The plugin displays a shortcode for the add block which you can enable. It lets you insert AdSense units via a PHP function. AI enables you to preview ad units. I'm using Ad Inserter on multiple sites and have never been disappointed with it.

### Easy Adsense

If you don't want to see ads on smaller posts of your site, use easy AdSense. Unlike the above two plugins, EA gives you the option to add ad units only on the articles whose length exceeds the number n ( you set n). It can also add titles for ad units.

If you're using affiliate pictures on your blog, Easy AdSense can be configured to display a border when a user hovers on the ad. Thus it helps to improve the conversion rate for an affiliate network. If you are using this plugin, don't turn on this option for AdSense units as it is violating Google terms and conditions.
