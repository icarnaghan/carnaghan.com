Bloggers want a lot of features in their themes. They also expect their WordPress blogs and websites to load fast. Free templates have limited support and features. Thus, many of the bloggers buy a premium template. Before they make payment, the user will explore 100s of available options. This task induces a headache and creates a lot of confusion.

Thus, it is a job for professional and experienced bloggers like me to make newbies or WordPress users aware of the top themes. Last week, we published a detailed review of Newspaper template. Today, we've discussed one of the most popular and powerful WordPress theme named X. No other WP template is as perfect and user-friendly as X.

Themeco is the developer of X. The design and development team has put a lot of hard work to make their latest template compatible with every mobile device in the world. They're experts in responsive designs.
