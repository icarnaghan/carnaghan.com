Email Optin forms are useful because they attract visitor's attention. When a visitor signs up with the form, the website will have a new loyal reader.

Newsletters will bring referral traffic to your blog. If your site is not ranked in search engines, you can still get free traffic provided that you send a newsletter to an email address or share blog posts on social media networks or the best bookmarking websites.

The task of Sending newsletters can be easily accomplished with Mailchimp. All you have to do is add an email optin form to your website and wait for the visitors to sign up for updates. But wait! Things are not as easy at it seems to be.

Adding a newsletter form to the sidebar will not guarantee new subscribers.

If you're planning to use a free email opt-in plugin, then you're wasting your time. Plugins of this type have very limited features. They're not CPU and RAM friendly, and you can have issues with your hosting provider. Free email opt-in form generators have limited options. They generate forms of 1 or two styles and prompt you to buy a premium version of their junk.

The plugins support sidebars. They won't allow you to add opt-in forms to the hottest position of your website.

If you're a developer like Me, you can develop your subscription form and add it to any position of your choice. If you're not a developer, you've to be smart in choosing a WordPress plugin that generates newsletter aka email opt-in subscription forms.

Because of its unique templates, Bloom makes you site attractive without impact page load time. Unfortunately, the plugin is not free.

It is not very expensive as you'll have access to plenty of premium resources developed by the talented engineers at Elegant Themes.
