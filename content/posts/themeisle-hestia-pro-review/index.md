Hestia Pro is a powerful material design based WP template with which you can launch websites of various types without writing a single line of code. It is one of the best multi-purpose WordPress themes. According to Themeisle, the developer of Hesita Pro, HP is idle for business, blog, e-commerce sites based on the WordPress content management system.

Is the Hestia Pro theme SEO friendly and fast? Should you replace your current theme with it? Here's my review of this premium WP template:

### Header

![Hesita Pro frontpage](images/Heista-Pro-frontpage-1.jpg) HP has a large header section where you can add a CTA button, menubar, and a custom logo. Hestia Pro provides an option to add a header background image and make the navigation bar sticky. It lets you add a search box to the menubar and align the menus to the center, left or right side of the header. The 1st option comes in handy when you don't want to add a search box to the sidebar or footer section of the theme.

HP can display a topbar above the main navigation bar. You can change the appearance and alignment of the menus of the theme's top bar.

Users can configure HP to display an interactive slider in the header area and open menu links in a new tab. One of the coolest features of the premium Hestia Pro theme is its support for mega menus. Your mega menu can have multiple columns. Apart from mega menus, HP supports multi-level single column menus.
