Many website hosting providers offer better features and more free add-ons but if budget is not a problem for you, choose a product on the basis of its quality, not quantity. Frankly speaking, the best hosting companies in the world are Hostgator and Bluehost.

Hostgator is a superb platform for hosting websites, but if your site has been banned for high resource utilization or some other reasons, you should consider signing up with Bluehost as it offers similar features.

This company has been active since 1996/1997. It is older than HostGator, GoDaddy, etc. If people did not like its services, Bluehost would have exited the business within a few years. This service powers over 2 million websites, and it offers high-quality customer support.

If you are planning to be a customer of Bluehost, your decision is right. Read the below review to know why we are recommending Bluehost to our readers.

We've also shared a detailed comparison of Hostgator and Bluehost plans and services. Thus, we've made it easier for you to decide which hosting service and plan is suitable for your site.

### Installing WordPress on Bluehost

Like many other providers, Bluehost comes with one click installer. Open this utility from the CPanel and install the CMS on the server. Once you install WordPress, you should login to your dashboard and setup Yoast SEO plugin and your theme.

Bluehost plus comes with excellent benefits that include unlimited hosting, disk space, bandwidth, etc. It has a usage policy where the action might be taken on webmasters whose blog's DB size exceeds 3GB. It also offers global CDN, i.e., CloudFlare (a content delivery network for improving website speed).
