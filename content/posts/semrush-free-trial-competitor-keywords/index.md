Professional bloggers are successful because they make wise use of SEO tools. For example, Pat Flynn, the owner of smart passive income has launched a few niche blogs that earn him over 5000 dollars every month. Patt is one of the most intelligent bloggers in the world. He makes more than 50000 dollars every month by promoting various products. He makes use of different keyword research tools.

Amit Agarwal, the top Indian blogger, initially used Google Keyword Planner to find relevant and high traffic keywords, as a result, his blog labnol generates more 2.5 million INR revenue through AdSense. Most of the articles on his site labnol.org rank on 1st page of Google.

If you're a newbie blogger, you can't compete with labnol or smart passive income. But you can focus on writing articles whose title has low competition keywords. This technique will bring traffic to your blog. Or if you've published a lot of articles and your site is generating just 100 to 150 dollars income through Adsense, you should focus on increasing Adsense CPC & CTR.

Researching high paying keywords on keyword planner is a time-consuming task. If you use an SEO tool like SEMRUSH, your time will be saved. SEM RUSH is an all in one SEO tool that can make you aware of keywords that bring traffic to the competitors site. It also displays the keyword CPC. This website offers more than ten useful tools. But many people use to it analyze competitor keywords.
