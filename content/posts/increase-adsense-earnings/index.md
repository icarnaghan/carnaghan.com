Adsense is one of the best platforms to earn money online, but not everyone is successful with it. Some bloggers make 500+ dollars per month just with AdSense and others have to satisfy themselves with just 50 or 100 USD. If people use black hat methods and cheat Google, their accounts are banned immediately.

To be honest, you don't have to cheat, nor you have to waste time in using websites that claim to increase your ad revenue. If you work smartly and hard, your Adsense income will increase. Today, we'll share some effective tips and strategies that will help you to earn more cash with Google's publisher program.

Before you go ahead and implement the strategies that I've shared below, you should know that to have a good income via Adsense, your website or blog should have a lot of visitors from search engines.

### Earnings depend on the traffic source and location

The CPC rates for an Asian country is considerably lower as compared to that of Canada, Europe, US, Australia and NZ (New Zealand). So if your site doesn't have decent traffic from these five countries, don't expect your site to earn more than 400 dollars unless it gets over 500000 monthly unique visitors.

Please note that visitors should arrive from Google or Bing. Google will not like traffic from paid advertising or social networks like FB, Twitter or Instagram.

## Tips to increase Adsense earnings without increasing traffic

**Position 1:**

### To the top of post aligned to the left.

This is the best Adsense position in my perspective. Add a responsive ad unit that adjusts to 300 x 250 or 336 x 280 size on desktops/tablets and 234 x 60 on mobiles. Displaying large size advertisement on the top of the blog post in a smartphone is a bad idea.  You can use a free WordPress Adsense plugin if you don't know how to add ad units manually by editing single-post.php WordPress file.

**Position 2:**

### Below blog post:

This is the 2nd best place. Ads placed here will get a lot of clicks. You can add rectangle size AdSense unit.

The above two positions will earn you a lot of dollars. CTR at these locations in usually within 2 to 3.0 (which is good).

**Position 3**:

### Center of the sidebar

Sidebars are not the best AdSense spots but, you can still earn money from it. Place a large size ad unit, i.e., 300 x 600 or 160 x 600 to the center of the sidebar. Don't add it above the fold because Google will penalize your blog or site because this algorithm is live.

I'm not a huge fan of the center of blog post position as you don't know where exactly the ad will be placed. Sometimes, the unit will be aligned with the image or above an irrelevant label/text, i.e., download here, click here, etc.

When you change the position, make sure that your site follows Adsense policies. For example, if the modified position will cause the ad appear directly below the header/title or under social network icons, remove it as it is against Adsense policies.

The social buttons might cause accidental clicks. If Google finds this on your blog, your AdSense account will be suspended or banned.

### Use AdWords keywords planner tool

Before you write a blog post, use keyword planner tool to do research on LSI keywords. This tool will display expected CPC for the keywords. Shortlist the words and write the article for it. This strategy will increase Adsense earnings. It will also improve your website's organic traffic. You can also use Long Tail Pro for the same.

**Conclusion**:

Adsense is a powerful and the highest paying ad network in the world. There are no good alternatives to it. Affiliate marketing can pay you well, but it will take a lot of time for you to master it. Use the strategies we've shared above to improve your earnings/income with Google Adsense.
