The redesign of http://www.richardccook.com has been completed.  Richard requested a new website design that would be easy for him to update and blog about his latest articles.  We completed a Wordpress based site with a fresh custom design.

Rick is a former U.S. federal government analyst who in 1986 became one of the foremost whistleblowers of modern times. He was instrumental in exposing multiple layers of cover-up in the wake of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. As a witness to the incident and a participant in the subsequent investigations, he received the Cavallo Foundation Award for Moral Courage in Business and Government for his testimony. In 2007, his memoirs of the tragedy were published in a book entitled: _Challenger Revealed: An Insider’s Account of How the Reagan Administration Caused the Greatest Tragedy of the Space Age_. It has been called by one reviewer, “The most important space flight book in 20 years.”
