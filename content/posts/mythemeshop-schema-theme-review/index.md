Buying a premium WordPress theme ensures that you'll be given assistance when you encounter problems with the theme.

The theme will have clean code and it will be search engine and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, the premium theme which I used earlier on this blog was a waste of my money. I had bought it when I was a newbie blogger after reading a review.

The theme was good initially, but the developer removed its inbuilt review system. When I asked the development team why they did so? They asked me to wait for a few weeks because they'll be launching a review plugin. It has been 5 months now, the plugins have not been released yet. All my reviews and the schema start rating markups were gone.

Recently, I updated PHP on my VPS server to PHP 7.0. The theme started to fumble even though the server had enough free RAM and CPU. I raised a support ticket to seek help on this issue. The team closed the ticket claiming that they'll check the code of the theme. I waited for several weeks hoping that the developer will fix the issue and release a new update for the theme.

No update was released. I then decided to move on and buy a theme from a renowned WordPress theme development company. After researching a bit, I ended up buying the MyThemeShop schema theme.

I was confused between Genesis Framework and MTS Schema because both templates were having valid schema markups. Unfortunately, Genesis framework developer Studiopress have limited free child themes to offer. Schema theme looked similar to Genesis Metro Pro theme which costs around 90 USD. I decided to buy MTS Schema because of its SEO friendly nature**.**

MyThemeShop has launched over 50 premium and impressive themes. In the future, I may replace the current theme with some another template. Buying 50+ themes individually will cost around $2500. Luckily, I came to know that MTS runs VIP membership program that allows you to download all premium themes and plugins for just $87 (discounted link).

Hence, Instead of downloading Schema template that costs $59, I became a VIP member. Now, I have access to all premium MTS templates (including Schema). If you're planning to buy the MyThemeShoop schema theme, then you have made the right decision. The template offers the below features:

### Valid Schema markups
