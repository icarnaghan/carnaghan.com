Out of all the website and Wordpress template sellers out there, Template Monster is clearly the king. Reigning in the business for the past couple of years, the company has grown substantially to offer tens of thousands of templates to it's many customer's.

A few months ago they launched a new blog, Template Monster's Blog. It was mostly filled with updates at first, but growing beyond news from the site they also added many articles and tutorials on website design. Recently it has attracted a lot of attention, including a few articles to hit Digg's Frontpage.

I've been reading their articles for a few weeks, and I'm a big fan. They write about some really interesting topics, and a lot of their inspirational posts collected and contain some very useful templates.

I've also seen a lot of Wordpress gallery posts, sharing some of the best Wordpress designs from all across the web. These are classic staple posts on many other design blogs, and Template Monster seems to get their fill and run it properly with the company backing it.

I would suggest giving some of their articles a read. With content hitting the front page of Digg many times and even getting to the front of TweetMeme, clearly they're doing something right on the blog. I look forward to the future results, especially traffic spikes and increases in template sales.
