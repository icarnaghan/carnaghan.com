WordPress is the best blogging software and free content management system. It performs well on a powerful server. If the server has a poor configuration, WordPress may not provide the best experience.

Websites hosted on an underpowered server suffers from heavy downtimes. The website takes ages to open on the visitor's browser. This results in poor user experience. As the first impression is the best impression, visitors may not visit your site in the future. Search engines fuelled by Artifical Intelligence can distinguish between a user-friendly and a user-hostile website.

A site that provides horrible experience to visitors will never perform well in search results.

Being a widely used software, a large number of web hosting companies are introduced every month. While some companies offer high-quality services, there are some firms that run only for one reason - earn money.

To prevent losses, the companies introduce cheap WordPress hosting plans so as to attract a large number of customers in short time.

Apart from the compelling plans, some web companies buy fake reviews from professional writers. The reviews appear to have been written by a real customer.

After buying a hosting plan from a company with fake reviews, the website owners may feel that their money has been wasted. This is the time when they decide to decide to switch to another hosting provider.

If you are feeling cheated, don't waste your time in writing negative reviews. Buy WordPress hosting from one of the following companies.
