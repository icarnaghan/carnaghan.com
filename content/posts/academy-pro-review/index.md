The next section flaunts testimonials. When customers enjoy your service, they'll appreciate your work. If customers have sent you appreciation emails, you can proudly display the emails in the testimonial section of the Academy Pro theme. You can add up to 3 testimonials in this section.

Below this section, you'll find the details of the instructor/business owner and his/her image. The Academy Pro theme allows users to add an opt-in form and an accordion in its 5th section.
