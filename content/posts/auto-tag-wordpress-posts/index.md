WordPress tags are important, no matter how small or large a site is. Tags allow users to group posts. They make website navigation easier. They allow search engines to discover and index new posts quickly. WordPress Related posts plugins use tags to calculate post relevancy and display related articles below blog posts.

Human beings make mistakes. Sometimes, a webmaster may delete an important tag unintentionally. Once a tag is removed, the structure of the related post on your site may change. If you have a small blog with 10 to 20 posts, readding tags manually shouldn't be a problem. If you own a large site, readding tags to posts is an annoying task. The best way to add tags to blog posts is to use Automatic Post Tagger WordPress plugin.

Once you enter the tags, scroll down and set the number of posts you want the plugin to process at a time and time the plugin should wait for processing the next batch of posts.
