This is the final Axure prototype that will be developed for this project.  It build on the design of prototype 5 and increased consistency between screens.  Additional data elements were added and the interface for creating and managing case studies was redesigned.  Axure has been a useful tool for developing these initial prototypes, however limitations of static web pages and producing complex interactions has proven to be time consuming and difficult.  <!--more-->Moving forward, a real ASP.NET application will be developed for future discussion and usability testing.
