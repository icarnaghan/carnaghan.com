Social bookmarking websites are important as they can bring tons of visitors to your blog. They will also increase your post's ranking and visibility in search engines. There are two categories of bookmarking sites, i.e., nofollow and dofollow.

Most do follow sites that allow you to share links are considered as spam by Google. Sites that link to such bookmarking portals are penalized, and they don't rank anywhere in top 20 to 25 pages of the search engine. People promoting these websites don't know SEO, and you should avoid following their tips.

Most social bookmarking sites are penalized because they promote link schemes - a violation of Google guidelines. For best results, the link user shares should be attributed as nofollow.

Nofollow bookmarking portals are safe, and they're found all over the web because these sites follow Google webmaster guidelines. They don't promote spam nor do they pass juice to external links. If you use them often, these sites will bring traffic to your blog. Below are the top sites for bookmarking and sharing your articles.

## Top 10 Best social bookmarking sites list for 2016

### Reddit:

In my perspective, this is the best social bookmarking site. Registration of Reddit is free, and you can use it for entire life. To promote your article, you should choose a sub-Reddit wisely. If your story is on money making tips or strategies to sell products online, you should submit your link in the marketing section. If the user finds your link useful, they'll upvote it. Referral traffic from Reddit depends on these votes. Links that receive a lot of votes are on the 1st page of this site. Google ranks top articles shared on Reddit on the 1st two pages of the search results. This site is moderated. If you try to spam it, your profile will be banned. Open this website.

### Pinterest:

### Why should you post on social bookmarking sites?

The portals we've shared above have a very high domain and page authority. Even though they are all nofollow; you should share your articles on them wisely without spamming. If users like your post title/description, they'll visit your website. If you've added affiliate advertisements in your post or sidebar, the visitor referred through Reddit, Quora or another site might buy the product you've recommended.

Use the above social bookmarking websites wisely. Don't spam them and keep the internet clean!
