The University of Maryland University College (UMUC) is getting ready to begin its second semester of offering their new Cybersecurity programs, which opened to students in the fall of 2010. Two masters programs as well as an additional specialization in one of their existing information technology degrees were introduced last semester, along with an undergraduate program. <!--more-->These very popular degree paths are aimed at individuals pursuing careers in information technology security, cybersecurity analysis, digital forensics and many others. This semester three new graduate certificate programs have been added in the Foundations of Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Policy and Cybersecurity Technology.

> The Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity policy programs are designed for midcareer professionals to help meet challenges posed by increasing cyber-threats. The programs are designed to provide a broad analytical framework for evaluating and solving cybersecurity problems.

All of the new cybersecurity courses are delivered online through the University’s online Course Management System WebTycho, which offers working professionals greater flexibility in their studies. The online system also provides students with advanced virtual security labs to enable them to combat simulated cyber attacks.

Cybersecurity is a hot topic these days with many concerns over privacy rights and online security threats. We just have to look in the headlines of recent weeks with regards to the issues of leaked documents via the Wikileaks website and the government’s commitment to providing more funding for cybersecurity initiatives. Threats such as identity theft, malware and viruses, are on the rise. Other areas of concern include the increase of cyberterrorism and theft of corporate intellectual assets. The formation and growth of cybercrime organizations, similar in many ways to the mafia are also on the rise.

UMUC is located in the heart of the Washington DC Metro area where many federal positions, especially within Homeland Security, are opening up for cybersecurity professionals. For more information on the programs available, visit UMUC.
