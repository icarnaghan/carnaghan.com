The use of mobile devices including policies and employee restrictions should be considered in any modern network security architecture. Mobile devices are used commonly both at home and at work with some organizations managing BYOD (Bring your Own Device) policies. It is therefore important to consider the implications of this and to ensure any BYOD device is properly locked down, authorized and managed within the corporate network. Westervelt (2010) published an article several years ago on the high amount of vulnerabilities discovered within mobile devices. Many of which were reminiscent of earlier / legacy web application issues. Homeland Security Newswire published an article on the ‘new’ cybersecurity threat of smartphone apps that do more than they say they do in terms of hidden malware and other threats. n.d. (2010).

Modern network security architecture should take into consideration the threats posed by not only issued and BYOD devices, but also unauthorized hardware connected to the network. Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should accommodate mobile devices and stricter policies put in place. Scope of penetration testing can include physical and communications exploits as well as system exploits.  Bosworth (2009). Mobile hardware causes the overall scope of security policy to be affected when compared to just looking for traditional technology hardware and software. Organizations need to continually adapt and review their evolving network security architecture to ensure they continue to mitigate threats from the ever-changing world of mobile devices.
