People are often confused in choosing a hosting service for their sites. On the internet, you will find details on 100s of web hosting companies. Yesterday, one of our readers dropped me an email to know which is the best hosting among Bluehost, Justhost, and HostMonster.

The reader was confused because the plans and features offered by the companies are almost the same. I have shared a comparison of JH, HM, and BH in this article to help our readers in buying the best hosting plan for their site.

## Justhost vs Bluehost vs HostMonster

#### Company details

When it comes to hosting, you should always signup for a bigger brand. A company with a better revenue will have better infrastructure.

Moreover, a distinguished organization will take every effort to make sure that it remains at the top position. To do so, it offers good quality services, servers with the latest hardware, etc.

When a company becomes a globally renowned brand, it is under tremendous pressure to keep up the good name.

Interestingly, Bluehost and HostMonster companies were started by the same person, Matt Heaton. BH was incorporated before HM. HM is recognized as a sister company of HG.

Chris Philips established JustHost in 2008. One more interesting fact is that the EIG owns the three companies.

Bluehost is the better brand than HostMonster and Justhost. It has more users than the two companies and has excellent ratings from their existing users.
