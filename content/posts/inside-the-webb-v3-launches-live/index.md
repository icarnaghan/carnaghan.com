Version 3.0 of Inside the Webb has finally launched live. Since our last design update in December I've been busy at work contemplating how I could take Inside the Webb to the next level. Well it hit me about a week ago, and since then I've been tweaking the latest and greatest design launch!

I've tried to go with a more simpler look, basing us more on the scale for social news. Reporting on all the hot topics of web 2.0 and social media, We encourage all site launchers and developers to contact us with your websites!

We're looking into writing articles about some upcoming talent, so if you're looking for a good market to get your ideas out there and publicized then don't hesitate to let us know. Along with that if you happen to know some really cool apps or sites online that you didn't create but just enjoy using, let us know about that, too! Sharing content with all the reader's of ITW is what I'm here to make happen.

Also, let me know what you think of the design! Comments, critiques, everything and anything is welcome in the comments. I'm willing to mull around with some good suggestions, and see if I can make some neat tweaks to the design.
