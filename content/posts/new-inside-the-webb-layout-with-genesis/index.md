It has been a while since the last major update to Inside The Webb, so I am pleased to post that today I completed customization of the new site layout using Studiopress Genesis Wordpress theme framework. <!--more--> Some of you may already be familiar with Genesis and Thesis (the other popular Wordpress framework for developing custom themes), however this has been a new and thankfully positive experience for me.

I have had some experience with developing Wordpress themes in the past so I was able to quickly get up to speed using Genesis.  The first thing I noticed was the amount of flexibility with layout options that are available out of the box.  Genesis has been designed with SEO in mind and comes with many features and options that can be set to best promote your site.  Studiopress also sell custom built or 'child' themes, which plug into the main framework, which can easily modified to suit many different types of Wordpress sites.

The new Genesis based at Inside The Webb was based on the old layout with the added benefits that the new framework brings to the site.  If you want to find out more about Genesis, please be sure to visit Studiopress.
