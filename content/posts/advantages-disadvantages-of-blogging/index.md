You may have recently learned that blogging is one of the best ways to earn money online. Hence, you might be planning to quit your regular job and pursue a career in blogging or you have just completed your education and want to become a full-time blogger.

Blogging is no doubt a great career option. If you become a successful blogger, you'll make more money than a manager, team leader, chartered accountants, doctors, etc.

A blog is very similar to one man IT startup. If you work hard, your audience will grow. Below are the advantages and disadvantages of blogging.

## Advantages

### Working from home

Most bloggers (including me) work from home. For a few months, your neighbors, friends, and relatives will be in a disbelief that you're a jobless person. As a blogger, the first thing you'll have to learn is to ignore people.

Once you become a full-time blogger, you'll be surrounded by people with negative thoughts. If you don't ignore people, you'll feel isolated, burdened, etc.

The biggest advantage of working from home is that you don't have to pay rents or travel to a distant location. Your bedroom will be your office.

### Working hours of a blogger

The biggest benefit of pursuing blogging as a career is that you don't have to work from 9 to 6. You can resume or begin your work anytime of the day.

### No work pressure

Your blog is your property. You can do anything with it. It's up to you to listen to the advice of people.

### Followers and fans

If your blog gets massive traffic, it will become a brand. People will discuss your site on forums, public places, etc. They'll share your content on social networks and follow your social profiles.

### Money

If you survive as a pro blogger for four or five years, you'll make a lot of money.

Newbie bloggers may not earn a single penny for a few months. If you've been blogging for 12 months more and you're not making enough money, you'll have to put in an extra effort.

## Disadvantages

### Blogging is not easy

Blogging is not an easy career to pursue. You will have to work really hard on the content. Hardworking bloggers with long term goals survive.

As a blogger, you must learn Google Webmaster Guidelines, SEO, marketing, etc.

Upgrading your skills will save a lot of money. For example, if you learn writing good quality articles, you won't feel the need to hire a writer.

If you learn PHP, CSS, JS, you won't have to hire a freelance programmer. You'll be able to customize your blog by yourself.

Starting a blog is easy but earning money through it is difficult.

### Immense frustration

When bloggers don't make enough money despite working hard, they'll be frustrated. As a blogger, you will have to learn to be patient and develop never giving up attitude.

### No guarantee that you'll earn money online

A regular job ensures that by the end of the month, your bank account will be credited with the salary.

A blog may or may not generate revenue for you. Starting a blog does not guarantee that a person will earn money online.
