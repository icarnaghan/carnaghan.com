WordPress supports taxonomies. In the WP CMS (content management system), the user can create as many tags and categories as they want.

A category is different from a tag. It is used to build a menu. If you create a treemap of WordPress structure, then the categories will always be the child of index or root page. They make navigation easier for the search bots and the visitors. On a small blog or a website, the webmaster should create only a few of them.

Multi niche blogs or WordPress based e-commerce site will have a lot of categories. WordPress supports two types of menu, simple and drop-down. A Simple menu bar should have a limited number of items else it will look ugly. You can add as many items you want in the drop-down menu bars.

The problem with drop-down navigation bar is that if the user adds a lot of elements to it, the menu bar will look cluttered, and it will confuse the visitor. In such cases, the webmaster should implement a WordPress breadcrumbs navigation on their website.

Breadcrumbs will help search engines understand the structure of the site. It is advisable to use only of a big multi-niche blog or a shopping portal. If a webmaster is not using a premium theme, he can quickly **add breadcrumbs to WordPress blog with the below free plugins**:
