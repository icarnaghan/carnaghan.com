The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched several programs over the years with the goal of improving healthcare in the United States. The Transforming Clinical Practices Initiative (TCPI) is one of these programs, that was built to support clinician practices through peer-based learning. The goals of this initiative is to facilitate large-scale practice transformation through several support structures, Practice Transformation Networks (PTN),  Support and Alignment Networks (SANS), and SANS 2. PTNs are peer-based learning networks with the aim of coaching, mentoring to support clinicians in practice transformation. SANs provide workforce development using existing education, competency and certification tools and support the recruitment of clinician practices in underserved communities. SANs 2 are a catalyst for the adoption of alternative payment models aimed at the new quality payment program.

Data analytics have been used to promote the efforts of TCPI through the adoption of a data collection system, providing user friendly ingest services. A data hub has been developed to add structure to the ingested data bits, turning them into a valuable resource for analysis and collaboration via a big data platform. The output from this effort is in the form of a report distribution portal providing modern, user friendly dashboards, reports, and exports for analysis and search capabilities. These capabilities have enabled the TCPI program to be better informed of the activities taking place within the networks. Data analytics have enabled the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to successfully set aims of the TCPI program, use data to drive care, achieve progress on the defined aims, achieve benchmark status, and support networks in thriving as a business via pay-for-value approaches improving health care services across the county.
