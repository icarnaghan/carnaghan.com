WordPress is claimed to be one of the most secure content management systems of the decade, but you need to take some precautions while using it.

The login page is accessible to everyone using the Internet. To access the page, the user has to enter example.com/wp-login.php simply. If you're using a weak password, then a software or a bot can easily hack your website.

Some hackers will target your site with a DOS or DDOS attack. If your hosting provider has not set up a firewall for your account, your website and web server will be down. If the site has many visitors, you'll lose some revenue. If the access to the wp-config file is not restricted, the hacker will get your database name and its password.
