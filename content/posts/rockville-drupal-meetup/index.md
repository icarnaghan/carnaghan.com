Are you a Drupal developer or someone who is interested in learning or hearing more about the platform?  Each month there are various 'meet-ups' that take place across the area.  ICF International now co-sponsors two of these meet-ups, one is held in our Fairfax office and the other in Rockville.  Last night we held our first Rockville meet-up, which was a big success.  <!--more-->We have been co-hosting the Rockville group with a company called WebFirst for the last 3 months and last night was the first time we hosted the group in the ICF office.  We had a guest speaker present on Drupal's organic groups, relational content strategies and organizing user permissions and access rights.  Next month we will have a developer from NIST presenting on Drupal module development.

Even if you are not a developer, there are going to be events that you may be interested in taking part in.  We have discussed the possibility of hosting Drupal learning sessions for people wanting to know more about the CMS and even how they might contribute to the open source community through code sprints and other volunteer opportunities.  If you are a project manager or business analyst, you will still find these events are great for increasing your awareness of the capabilities of Drupal.  Then of course there is the opportunity for networking with other local professionals in the area.

The Fairfax group meets on the third Thursday of every month and the Rockville group meets the second Wednesday of each month.  To look at upcoming events or to RSVP, please visit: http://www.meetup.com/drupal-dc/.

We look forward to seeing you at a future meet-up!
