Prototype 4 includes a lot of design changes stemming from our FSW and Winter Terms sprint.  These changes include improvements to the homepage and accomodation for non-expedition placeholders for FSW, winter and subject areas.  Other enhancements were made in the expedition forms and sub sections as well as proper differentiation between them and their non-expedition counterparts.  <!--more-->Further work needs to be done in order to improve cohesion between expedition and non-expedition areas of the application, especially needed for effective reporting later on.
