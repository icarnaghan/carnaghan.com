There have been quite a few videos in regards to the new Adobe Creative Suite 5, most specifically Photoshop and design software. There have been a lot of updates from the not-so-old CS4 set of Web and Graphic design software.

Adobe currently controls a large portion of the digital media market, and with their newest brand of software this will allow them to bump their skills up another level. This means developers working with Adobe Dreamweaver will have a much easier time, and Illustrator/Photoshop are both getting facelifts with countless new graphical features.

One of my favorite new features comes with their web development and server management software Dreamweaver. I have been using Dreamweaver since it was owned by Macromedia years ago. It's amazing software which allows for an amazing experience in web development.

As featured in the new CS5, you are now able to render your website right in the software. This works similar to how you can have 2 or 4 different windows up and compare how your site renders with many browsers including Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8, Safari on Windows and Mac, Firefox, plus many others!

Along from the countless new features, Dreamweaver will also support code highlighting and hinting for JavaScript libraries including jQuery and MooTools! This is an exciting step forward for UI developers, as Dreamweaver is now breaking it's chains of just ASP and PHP development (and some ColdFusion, too).

Photoshop also has some really exciting features I'm looking forward to, and also coming out with new features for After Effects and Soundbooth means that audio and video producers are going to see serious updates as well. I probably won't be able to upgrade right to the new software immediately, as I usually take some time and see how the general response from the public is.

One thing is for certain, though. Adobe does know how to reel in an audience and keep us at the edge of our seats. They've produced 4 updates so far since launching their Creative Suite lineup, and their 5th set is going to easily be their greatest software library to date.
