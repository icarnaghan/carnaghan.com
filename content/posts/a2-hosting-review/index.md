## A2 hosting review

A2 is easy to get started with. Once you buy hosting from A2, you must log in to your account (CPanel or Plesk). CPanel and Plesk make website management easy for the users. You can install applications, backup up the data, install SSL certificate, see logs,Â manage databases, files, DNS with these 2 tools.

### Windows and Linux hosting

A2 servers are powered by Windows or Linux OS. Depending on the technology stack of your website, you can choose between Linux and Windows OS.

The A2 Windows hosting supports ASP.NET, MS SQL, Silverlight, etc. You don't have to log in to the server via SSH and type commands. A2 offers a Plesk control panel with which you can install and manage the Web and DB server.

### Server configuration and software

#### SSD

A2's servers employ SSD aka solid state drives. For those who don't know, SSDs are faster than mechanical hard disk drives. They use NAND based flash memory. Don't worry! The data won't be wiped off when you reboot the server. SSDs can write data to the chips at a blistering speed of 550 Mb/seconds.

#### PHP 7

Facebook HHVM was a great alternative to PHP until Zend Technologies/PHP development team introduced PHP 7.0. The latest version of the world's most popular scripting language delivers the same performance as HHVM.

#### Free SSL and SSH

SSH is a protocol that allows users to manage files, web or database servers from a remote location. If you have knowledge of Unix, you can manage the files on your server via SSH. A2 hosting allows users to install SSL certificate on their server with a single click. When you enable SSL for your site, the browser will display a green colored "https" text to the left of website URL in the address bar.

#### Supported applications

A2 hosting supports several popular applications. It provides a one-click installer for Drupal, WordPress, OpenCart, Joomla, Magento, etc.

Once you install an application and DB server, you can create a new DB and import the data from a backup file. If this a daunting task for you, create an "Account Migration" ticket and the support staff will move your website from the old server to A2 server.

### Data Centers

A2 Hosting enables users to chose the location of the server. As of now, the firm has a data center in the following countries.
