Today a short meeting was held to discuss the overall progress of the prototype to date and demonstrate the key functionality to the EL representative for the school.  Comments were made on how further improvements could be made to the data collection part of the system.  The group is going to review the prototype over the next week further and share feedback at our next meeting.  <!--more-->Once data collection requirements have been finalized, the next phase of design will concentrate mainly on reporting.
