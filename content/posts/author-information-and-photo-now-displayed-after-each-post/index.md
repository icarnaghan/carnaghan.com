Yep, I finally decided to add some of those updates I had planned on rolling out so long ago! I've been meaning to add author info to the posts on Inside the Webb for a while, just haven't had time. Well I finally found some time, and I'm glad I did!

I really like the box style and how neatly they fit right after posts. It only took about 15-20 minutes messing around with Wordpress theme files and CSS styles to get it looking how it does now. Even though I am the only author on board now, in the future I plan on running with many different writers. This gives them a chance to really express what they're about, and give the reader an in-depth look.

Either way this was an update long overdue. I'm hoping to roll out a few _secret_ updates in the near future, as this is just one of many to come! I hope you all like it, and share your ideas with me about what you'd like to see in Inside the Webb.

So I have been hard at work over the past couple of days sprucing up ITW. I gave the entire site a new color scheme and design, plus revamped the content and page designs. I figured this news really didn't need a new post, so I just updated the old one I had made.

Among the changes are that our social media sharing links now have their own section! Not just that, but I've swapped the plain images for interactive buttons and widgets from specific sites for social media and news sharing. I hope this encourages everyone to share and vote my articles, and if you have recommendations for others to add let me know!

Also among changes are the new colors and layout. I think the dark backgrounds help the content really stand out as foreground, and I haven't looked back since changing it. I hope you all see the beauty in Inside the Webb's new design, and let me know your thoughts as well!
