Illuminate is the code name for a curriculum mapping project I am currently developing as part of my Doctoral thesis.  I will be using this part of the blog to document my progress as development progresses.  My plan is to have a version 1 of Illuminate completed by the spring of 2014.<!--more-->

Illuminate will be a web-based curriculum mapping application for K-12 expeditionary learning.  The purpose of the application will be not only to provide school administrator reporting and top level access, but to also provide tools for teachers to create, share and collaborate lesson plans with each other.

The application will be built using the ASP.NET MVC 4 technology stack along with other open source contributions from Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery UI for the interface, Entity Framework for the Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and NUnit and Moq for unit testing.
