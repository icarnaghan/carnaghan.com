CDN aka content delivery networks improves the performance of your site. They reduce the latency by serving JavaScript and CSS files from the location closest to the visitor.

A CDN provider may have several data centers spread across the world. When you signup for the CDN service, the service will cache static resources of your site on a server nearby the location you specify. You'll have to install a CDN plugin so as to change the website resource URL.

For example, the plugin may change the URL in following format http://example.com/d1/d2/d3/d4/style.css to cdn.example.com/style.css.

If the CDN service provider has several data centers, your site's assets will be synced to many machines. When the visitor tries to access your site, the server nearest to the users will send the cached files as a response.

The CDN services support minification of files and they also compress images so as to improve their loading time.
