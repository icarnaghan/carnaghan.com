This is impressive because your blog will be hardly down. Thus your online earnings and revenue will not be impacted by unnecessary downtime.

Once my high traffic site was down for 3 hours when it was hosted on ASO, my Adsense earnings for the day were down by a few dollars. With SG, you will never experience such issues because the infrastructure of Siteground hosting company is good.

The great thing about site ground is that you've to pay for the resource you use. For example, the cheapest hosting plan, i.e., startup costs around 4 dollars, and it is suitable for sites with 10000 visitors per month. This plan comes with a limitation that you can host a single domain with it.

If your blog is getting 25k visitors per month, Siteground has a special 5.95 dollars GrowBig plan for you. For growing blogs with less than 100K visitors, there's a powerful 11.9 USD GoGeek plan. GrowBig and GoGeek can be used to deploy more than one websites.
