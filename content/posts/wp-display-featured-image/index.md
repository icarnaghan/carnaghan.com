Featured image is a picture that appears in the post excerpt. When the visitor sees the image, he will find the topic interesting, relevant, and will not hesitate in exploring your website further.

All the premium and free WordPress themes launched these days support FI. If your website has 100s of posts, it is difficult to set featured images manually unless you are ready to edit posts one by one. You don't have to do so because the below free plugins will automate this task for you.

### WP featured images: Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Makes a website user-friendly.

Cons of featured images:

**Increases disk space usage**: If you are using a hosting service that does not support unlimited storage, your site may run into a problem. Because of the FI, an extra file will be stored on the server. The plugin/theme may generate many more files in addition to this. At one point in time, there will be no room left your storing files and you'll be forced to move your WP website to another hosting provider.

**Page load time**: As an additional file will be served in a reply to the HTTP request, you will notice that your site's home page loading speed has increased.

**Increased bandwidth**: Most shared hosting plans have limitations on the number of bytes of data a website can transfer every month. If you enable featured images on your site, the images will be sent to the visitor's computer everytime he/she requests the page. If your site gets tons of repeat visitors, you can save bandwidth by installing and activating a WordPress caching plugin which will add an exipiry time to the pictures.

**Conclusion**: The plugins mentioned above will help you in adding a featured image to the post excerpt. They are free to download.
