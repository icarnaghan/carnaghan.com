I am extremely fond of the new social news script Pligg CMS. I have been following it since early release, and updating Pligg sites used to be very difficult. However from instructions from this wiki, you can use TortoiseSVN to control the version and upgrades of your Pligg site with ease.<!--more-->

Below I've also added a small video. This was created by Pligg user Yankidank to help out those who are unfamiliar with TortoiseSVN. It's a quick and easy tutorial to follow, and it's really useful for updating your Pligg installations!
