Unlike tech and WordPress niche, food blogging is not a competitive niche. Hence, if you share unique recipes on the food blog, you can make good money online.

If you're planning to start a food blog or you already own a food blog, your objective should be to get as many loyal visitors as you can and make money from the site without affecting the visitor experience. To get desired results, you must use a powerful and SEO friendly food blog theme. One of the best templates for the recipe sites is Foodie Pro.

Foodie Pro is a widely used Genesis child theme. It is designed for food bloggers by experts. Here's my review of this template.

## Foodie Pro review

### Customizable home page

Like other top Genesis themes, Foodie Pro theme lets you customize the homepage with powerful widgets. You can use this feature to display featured posts containing affiliate links or ads, your new or evergreen articles, etc. If you place the widgets wisely on the home page, a visitor will explore more pages on your website. Thereby reducing the bounce rate. A site with a high bounce rate is less likely to perform well in the SERPs.

To customize the home page, drag and drop the widgets which you want to see on the home page. You can configure the Foodie Pro template to show posts in a grid layout with up to 6 columns.

The theme allows users to add widgets directly below the post. This position is very important and highly converting for any site. It is the place where smart bloggers place AdSense ad units or newsletter subscription form. After post widget area feature is exclusive to only Genesis Framework. I've used several premium themes. None of the themes provide this feature.

To place the ad unit or a subscription form below the post, I used to edit the theme's single.php page. If you are using the Foodie Pro theme, you don't have to edit pages. Simply drag and drop the widget of your choice. You can also experiment with different widgets to know what widgets or ad units are performing well.

The Foodie Pro theme allows you to place widgets in the footer area. You can add social network profile widgets, 728 x 90 ad unit, featured posts, Instagram feed, etc.

### Design

The Foodie Pro WP theme supports full-width layout.

Foodie Pro theme is based on HTML5 markup. It has a responsive design. Hence, the page elements will be automatically resized when the user is browsing your site on a tablet or a mobile device. The FP theme lets you create a stylish menu bar that features social network icons and a search box.

The theme employs white color scheme so that you can flaunt your work and recipe photos with pride. The theme doesn't use heavy pictures nor does it transfers large stylesheets to the client device. Hence, it opens quickly on desktops and mobile devices.

Foodie Pro provides three color styles it allows you to set featured images for blog posts.
