Like OptinMonster, the SumoMe includes a list builder module which provides an A/B testing feature, with which you can improve the conversion rate. OptinMonster and SumoMe provides a good number of design and customization options. The default popup of SumoMe is ugly. It is small. You'll have to spend some time in customizing it. Making changes to an existing design is time-consuming.

### Design

Two of the most sophisticated lead generation plugins are OptinMonster and SumoMe. The plugins let you create slide-ins, beautiful lightbox pop-ups, floating bars, sidebar forms, and more. Users can easily insert the forms designed and built with them in post or page below or above content.

OptinMonster provides drag-drop page builder to design opt-in forms quickly. SumoMe doesn't support drag-n-drop function yet.

### Page targeting

OptinMonster allows you to set targetted messages for categories and pages. This feature is awesome because it can increase conversion rate dramatically. Each page on your site may be unique. For example, you may promote WP theme on one page and a plugin on another. Hence, showing the same message and opt-in form doesn't make sense. SumoMe doesn't have page level targeting feature.

### Visitor and browser

OptinMonster and SumoMe has a function that automatically triggers a pop-up box prompting the visitor to enter his/her email address.

### Analytics

To track conversion rate, both the lead generation WP plugins offer analytics feature. The Analytics dashboard is intuitive and accurate. OM plugin provides more detailed statistics than SumoOme.
