### What did I like about the theme?

**Features**: Unlike some themes that provide tons of confusing/useless options, News Pro is easy to configure. You don't have to waste your precious time in configuring options that won't help your website's ranking in search engines or visitor.

**Stylesheet size**: The theme's stylesheet size is just 10 kilobytes. Furthermore, it doesn't employ heavy or complex JS code. Hence, the site powered by the StudioPress NewsPro template will load quickly in the browser and score great in Google Page Speed tests.

**SEO Friendly**: News Pro is a responsive and SEO friendly magazine theme. The post title is embedded in the HTML h1 tag. H1 is one of the most important HTML elements on a web page. Many themes use display post title in the H2 tag, which is considered as inferior to H1 by many SEO experts. One more reason to use StudioPress NewsPro is that the theme passes Google structured data tests with flying colors.
