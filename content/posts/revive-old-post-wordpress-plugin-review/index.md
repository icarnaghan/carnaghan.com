Unlike search engines that rank pages on the basis of various factors, Social networking portals display posts in groups and on pages in first-in-last-out order. If the page is old, you'll have to scroll down the group until you find it. If the title of the post is interesting, people will share the post on their profiles or in groups they've joined. Such pages are called viral posts. They have the potential of bringing a large amount of traffic to a website.

Social Media platforms don't crawl and index web-pages of other sites. The only way to get traffic from social networking sites is to share pages in communities or on your profile. To do so, you must copy the URL/permalink, login to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and create a new post. If your site has 100s of posts, then finding a post to share won't be an easy task.

Sharing pages manually is a waste of time. Here's when the plugin Revive Old Posts comes in handy.

ROP is a WP plugin that increases social traffic by sharing old pages or blog posts automatically. In other words, ROP makes life easier for the user. To get started with the ROP, you must install/activate the plugin. Then, you must navigate to the ROP's setting page and link your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn account.
