Google has taken another step forward in visual and image search after acquiring UK-based startup Plink. Having only launched 4 months ago, Plink is a visual search engine which you can download as an Android app and take a photo of a picture to find out more information about it.

Plink has a lot of info in their official blog post, but it appears as thought he developers will keep Plink available for download but instead shift focus towards Google's equivalent Google Goggles.

With how quickly technology is growing, it's not surprising to see this kind of buyout from Google. They're an extremely innovative company and are currently leading us through this technological revolution. Combining a company such as Plink with their Google Goggles app for Android is amazing business strategy, and we'll see some serious results in the field of visual search over the next few months.

Although Google hasn't released any word as of yet, it's safe to say they have their own reasons for the buyout. I'm excited to see where they're going to take Google Goggles with this new staff of developers. Personally, I'm rooting for an iPhone app.
