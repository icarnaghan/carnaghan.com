The sidebar is one of the most critical section of a website. It not only helps in improving the revenue of a site by allowing users to place adverts above the fold but also helps in decreasing the bounce rate. On WordPress blogs, you'll find banners, related/latest/popular post's widget on the sidebar.

The content you add to the sidebar will be visible on all posts. If there are 1000 posts on your website, each and every advertisement or URL you'll add as a widget will be displayed on each post. You may have grouped your posts in many categories. Suppose there are four categories on your website - phones, laptops, tablets, and desktop. Imagine you've published an article on a notebook.

If you've added recent or popular post widget, the tablets, desktop and phone category pages will display a post title (with its URL) of a laptop. The post might not be of any interest to the user if he visited your site by finding a post on desktop, phone or tablet in the search result.
