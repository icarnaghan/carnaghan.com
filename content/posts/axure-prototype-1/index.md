This prototype was developed after the initial April 10th requirements meeting.  It includes a basic design with an incomplete 'dashboard' page providing user interactions for various parts of the system.  Upon learning more about the unique needs of EL, it was determined the main expedition form / interactions was fundamentally flawed.  <!--more-->

Some of the design came from earlier experience with non-EL curriculum mapping systems.  After some discussion, this prototype was eventually discarded and redesigned in version 2.
