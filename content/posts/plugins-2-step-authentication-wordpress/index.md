Dual factor authentication has become one of the most important security features in the last few years. Major websites like Google Mail, Outlook, Facebook are now protecting user accounts in a better way by allowing them to use a mobile device as their identity.

To activate 2 step authentication, the service provider will ask you to install Google Authenticator app (or any of its alternative). Some websites will ask you to verify the mobile phone number so that the authentication service will send a 4 or 5 digit code when required. This code will be used for one-time verification, and it will be valid only for a few hours.

If you’re using WordPress, you can easily protect your valuable website with a two-factor authenticator plugin. Before having a look at the plugins, let’s understand why this feature is important and useful:

**The site is secure**: Forget the login limiter or a security plugin, If 2 step authentication is enabled on your website, no one excluding you will have access to the WordPress dashboard. Even if someone gets your password, he will have to enter the authentication code generated by the app or send to your phone.

**Free**: 2 step authentication is free. You don’t have to buy any WordPress security plugin to protect the website. Follow the setup instructions and done!

### Best Plugins
