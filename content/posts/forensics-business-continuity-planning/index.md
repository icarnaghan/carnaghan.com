Business continuity planning in any organization today must incorporate aspects of computer forensics in order to be sustainable. According to Majore, Yoo & Shon (2014) in their article on secure and reliable electronic record management, over 90% of records created today are electronic. In addition to this electronic records require a greater amount of maintenance due to their volatility and dependence on reliable hardware and software. In continuity planning, organizations must face these challenges head on and prepare strategies that integrate digital forensics disciplines into their underlying processes.

In his article on digital forensics and its role in protecting the enterprise, Kenyon, P (2012) breaks down the usefulness of forensics in business continuity into two categories, reactive forensics and proactive forensics. Reactive of course includes post mortem analysis in order to glean knowledge and lessons learned. Proactive on the other hand refers to processes that can be integrated with continuity processes including but not limited to early warning systems and detection of potential anomalies and threats. As both the disciplines of business continuity and digital forensics evolve, they will continue to compliment each other in order to better prepare organizations for disaster recovery and ultimately protecting their digital assets.
