This prototype was developed after several discussions via email regarding the initial requirements of the project.  The kickoff meeting was helpful in framing the basics of the system in the first prototype, however it was lacking detail and missing some of the crucial elements of an EL map.   <!--more-->

Prototype 2 was built to include a range of new features, including a proper formed landing page where a teacher could login and have instance access to the various semesters.  The formatting and style were also given a face lift, and the sub-sections were fleshed out.  Prototype 2 will be discussed at the next requirements meeting.
