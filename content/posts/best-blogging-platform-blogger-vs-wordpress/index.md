WordPress and Blogger are 2 of the most popular blogging platforms/content management systems of all time. They are free to use. These 2 platforms are so powerful that users can build/launch a new website within a couple of minutes.

As a newbie, I used Blogger platform as I didn't want to risk my money in an adventure that I've never been a part of before. After 5 - 6 months, I migrated my site to WordPress. Well, if you're starting up with blogging and if you're confused in choosing the best blogging platform for you then please go through the below paragraphs:
