Elegant Themes DIVI 3.0 comes installed with a page builder tool which can be used by website owners to create responsive full-width layouts of their choice, and you don't have to edit any code for this. You just have to drag and drop your favorite elements to the desired location on the page.

The page builder is easy to use as the user just have to drag and drop elements they want to see on their site. There are more than 40 modules (including a contact form, email opt-in, video slider, social icons, etc) that you can add. You can change the width and height of the components easily with the page builder. If you don't have time to use this utility, use any of the 18 predefined layouts for your website or blog.

The page builder offers more features than other premium plugins of the same type. It lets you change the font, highlight specific text, stylize titles, showcase work portfolio, place galleries in pages, and more.
