The AI domain extension was launched in 1994/1995 for the use of companies and individuals based in a Carribean country Anguilla.

Google, the world's largest search engine doesn't display the information of Anguilla when you enter the search phrase as "AI". Even Bing displays Artificial Intelligence search results for the search phrase "AI".

In computer science, AI is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence. AI programs are self-learning applications that can be used for various purposes.

From airline industry to shipping and from banking to space, Artificial Intelligence is replacing human workforce. AI can be used to automate complex tasks. It can be used to predict the future of a company, market, etc. Robots are equipped with processor and RAM. Its activities are controlled by a machine learning application. Hanson Robotic's Sophia robot is a great example of the power of AI.

Well, AI is the future. If you have built an AI application or if you own or work for a company which develops artificial intelligence powered applications, then this is a great time for you. Why is this so? Well, not many people are aware that AI domains are now available for purchase on some sites. Fortunately, not many people have registered a .ai domain. Hence, the chances of finding an EMD name are great. Don't miss the opportunity! snap a perfect exact matching AI DN before your rival or friend does it.

As of today, Namecheap is the only renowned registrar that is selling the .ai. If you don't want your precious DN to be hacked, make sure you register your domain name with Namecheap.

#### Why Namecheap?

I don't recommend products until I use them. I have had a great experience as a Namecheap customer. I've registered two domains with NC and have never faced any issues till date. Once you buy the AI domain and login to NC, you'll see a beautiful dashboard. You can change the DNS address, lock your domain, configure redirects, etc through this interface.

When you deploy your application, must update the DNS address in the Namecheap dashboard. If you don't do so, no one would be able to access your app. The DNS propagation through Namecheap servers is fast. Hence, your application will be accessible by its domain name within an hour.

If the problem is at their side, they'll start working on your issue within few minutes. If the problem is at your end, the support staff will guide you to fix the problem.

**Pricing**: NC sells domains at a dirt cheap rate. Unlike some registrars that offer special discounts only to new customers, Namecheap's offers are available to all customers.
