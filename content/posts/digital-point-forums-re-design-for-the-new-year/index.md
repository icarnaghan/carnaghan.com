Of all the internet marketing and blogging forums out there, Digital Point was the first community I ever joined. I've been there for years, learned so much from the members and even contributed to helping others along their path. There are many other choices, but DP will always hold a special place in my heart.

After years of running the same design, DP has finally upgraded to a fresh web 2.0 look and feel to the entire site! Now running what is clearly the latest version of vBulletin 4.0 Forum Software, the latest design really kicks new life into such an expansive and helpful community.

### Additions and Newest Features

DP hasn't just updated their design, but along with the upgrade to the latest vBulletin install there are some new features to the site. There's an updated and easy-to-use User CP, with even more options than before. Customizing an unique and individual profile on Digital Point has never been easier. I've had my profile for over 2 years now.

There's also a new blog section to the site. It's unknown yet if everyone can write blogs or if it's limited to forum staff. Either way it should bring a bit more interaction into the site, and it's a much better way of sharing news with everyone!

Threads are now easier to reply to, comments easier to share, quoting posts are much easier, and overall the boards just look great. If you haven't checked out Digital Point Forums before, I'd recommend giving them a go. Especially for internet marketers and those of you interested in marking a living blogging.

I'm sure there will be more to share soon as more information arises. As for now all I can say is to check out the design, and leave some feedback as to what you think. Also, DP has added a link to their footer showcasing their new Twitter account @digitalpoint. I'm sure they'll be posting news of the new design and upgrade over the next couple of days.
