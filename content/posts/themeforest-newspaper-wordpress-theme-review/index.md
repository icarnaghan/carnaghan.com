Newspaper themes for WordPress are recommended for technology, travel, health, news, video and sports niche blogs. There are a lot of newspaper and magazine themes available for download in the wordpress.org directory. Most of them claim to be SEO friendly but unfortunately they're not.

Free themes have a major drawback that their support is limited. If you encounter any problems, you will have to post your query on WordPress.org forum. Most of the times, instead of the developers, other users will help you out.

The solutions shared by users other than the plugin/theme authors are risky. If you're recommended to modify the PHP or HTML code of your site, make sure that the code is correct and CPU friendly. Support is not the only drawback of free themes. HTML, Rich Snippets standards change from time to time.

If the developer doesn't launch/updates a template that adheres to the latest internet standard, the theme is of no use. As I've mentioned earlier, there are 1000s of templates (premium or free) available on the internet, today we'll discuss the feature of newspaper WordPress theme.

Out of 100s of premium WordPress magazine templates, TagDiv's newspaper is the best one that you can buy.

### Pricing

You can buy the TagDiv newspaper theme **on ThemeForest marketplace for 69 dollars**. This template is worth the money because the support is good.
