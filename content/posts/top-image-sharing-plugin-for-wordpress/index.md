A blog post is incomplete without images. Imagine if a site has no photos, will you spend your time going through the content?

A visitor to your website might be impressed with the picture you've embedded in the blog post. He may want to share the image on social networks. Some users may not waste their time in copying the photo URL by right clicking on the page. They may exit your website and use Google image search to get a link to the picture.

To avoid this scenario, download and activate on of the below best image sharing plugins for WordPress:

### Cool Image Share

I have tested this plugin on one of my blogs. It works well. Cool Image Share plugin adds a settings page to your website where you can manage the appearance, position, effects of the social buttons. It uses CSS3 to add icons at one of the below positions when user hovers his mouse cursor on the picture:

- Botton right, top left.
- Top Right, Center.
- Top Left.

You are allowed to set icon's orientation to horizontal or vertical and change its default size with this plugin. Cool Image Share can be configured by the users to add social buttons on pictures with a particular size and disable showing of icons on mobile devices.
