I am often interested in hearing about how people within the software development community keep up with the latest changes in tools, technologies and programming languages. It seems that every few months there is a new framework or better way of doing something in an entirely new tool-set or language. For me personally, I don't have much time during the day to spend reading the latest industry blogs and online development new outlets, so to help supplement this I routinely listen to a number of podcasts on my commute to and from the office.

## .Net Rocks!

As an ASP.NET developer I have found .Net Rocks! not only educational but entertaining, interesting and insightful. The show is produced three times per week, so there is always plenty of content to listen to! The co-hosts of the show, Karl Franklin and Richard Campbell have a great rapport and routinely interview very interesting and well known evangelists in the Net community. I especially enjoy their 'geek out' shows which they periodically host throughout the year on off-topic but highly interesting subjects such as space travel, nuclear technology, and more recently, an episode on Moore's law and the physics behind micro-processor technology. I have been listening to the show since 2011 and have learned a lot over the years on the many ASP.NET topics covered. For more information and to subscribe, visit http://www.dotnetrocks.com.

## Hanselminutes

If you're a .Net developer, Scott Hanselman is someone who doesn't need an introduction. This is a person who many in the industry have become inspired by through watching his presentations, reading his books, and of course, listening to his Hanselminutes podcast. Hanselminutes is a more general web development podcast and not specifically tied down to Microsoft technologies, which I believe is where its strength lies. In more recent months, Scott discussed other technology related topics such as 3d printing, electronics, and usability. Scott also runs another podcast called This Developers Life, however there have not been any new episodes for a while. Hanselminutes is published weekly.

## Drupalize.Me

For anyone who develops using Drupal, you will probably already be familiar with the excellent Drupalize.Me video training site. I am a member of Drupalize.me and frequently use their video tutorials to brush up on site building, front-end and back-end development skills for the CMS. The Lullibot team also publish the Drupalize.Me podcast, which is released typically every two weeks. The podcast covers a number of interesting Drupal development topics as well as up-to-date news and information about the community as a whole. More recently episodes covered interesting topics including distributed design, information on Drupalcon Bogata, front-end fundamentals, services and Drush and Composer. If you are a Drupal developer and are interested in keeping up with the latest in the community, this is the podcast for you.

## RunAs Radio

RunAs Radio is aimed more at I.T. professionals rather than developers, however it contains a lot of very interesting topics mainly around Microsoft Technologies. The podcast is hosted by Richard Campbell (the same Richard Campbell from .Net Rocks!) and Greg Hughes. Both co-hosts routinely interview well-known guests on the show and provide almost as much interesting and entertaining content as .Net Rocks! It is an interesting show to listen to as a developer as it covers a lot of topics that we don't have a lot of experience with in the dev-ops environment.

## CF Hour

Back in 2011 I wrote an article titled Get the Latest on ColdFusion at CFHour. This was the first development podcast I subscribed to and have been listening on and off since 2010. Originally the show was hosted by Dave Ferguson and Michael Sean Becker and later when Sean stepped down, Scott Stroz took on the role of co-host. Over the years the show has covered many important ColdFusion topics and provided coverage at various conferences. In more recent years I haven't followed the show with as much regularity because my work involves less ColdFusion coding these days, however I strongly recommend this podcast to anyone who has an interest or is developing in the language.
