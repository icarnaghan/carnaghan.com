After presenting the second prototype at the last requirements meeting, it was apparent that more work needed to be done with defining what an expedition is and where its sub-sections correctly belong.  Much of the discussion of the meeting concentrated on Standards, Learning Targets, Assessment (STAs) and their correct placement in the map.<!--more-->

It was agreed that case studies would house many of the sub-sections previously listed directly under the main expedition.  New dynamic tables were added to improve usability for entering new records.  The landing page was redesigned to include differentiation between expeditions and non-expedition activities.  Some of these non-expedition activities will need further definition in the next meeting.  The goal of the next requirements meeting should be to finalize the data-collection piece of the application so work can begin on reporting.
