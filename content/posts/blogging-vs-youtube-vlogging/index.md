Blogging and Vlogging are two sides of the same coin. Many people employ these two methods to earn money online.

In blogging, you start a new website and publish reviews and details of your favorite products, tips, etc.

In Vlogging, you ask someone to record your video or if you're publishing a video tutorial, you use a screen recorder tool to capture the desktop.

Below, I have shared a detailed comparison of Blogging and Vlogging. If you're looking forward to pursuing a career in Vlogging or Blogging, my comparison will clear your doubts.

### Expenses

The expenses of starting a professional blog are within 50 to 100 USD. You'll have to buy a hosting plan and register a domain name. You can also start a free blog on Blogspot.

The best hosting and domain registration companies have yearly plans. Hence, if your hosting package or domain is about to expire, you'll have to renew your package or domain.

YouTube allows all of its users to create a free channel. But to record videos, you'll have to buy a camera or smartphone that records 1080p, 4K or 720p videos.

YouTube will host your videos for free. The video hosting site will not shut your channel if it complies with YouTube policies.

### Skills required for Vlogging

If you are creative, have good communication skills, and a great command over English language, then you can become a Vlogger.

### Blogging skill required

You must have knowledge of Google Webmaster Guidelines, basics of SEO, and a good understanding of English grammar.

### Blogging vs YouTube or Vlogging: Which is better?

Frankly speaking, blogging is not that easy. Thousands of students, retired professionals, or jobless people get inspired by well-crafted blog posts and start a blog thinking that it will generate handsome income for them.

Before you spend your money, you should check the age of the website where you've read the benefits of blogging. Pages that rank in the first few pages of search engines are old. Google trusts these websites. Hence, they rank in Google.

New sites are less trustworthy. They don't have enough content. Unless you've published high-quality posts every day, Google won't send traffic to your site.

Google will reward your site with quality organic traffic only if you work hard on your site and follow Google webmaster guidelines.

Vlogging has now become difficult because Google has recently announced that your YouTube channel should have at least 10000 views to show advertisements. In other words, making money from YouTube has now become difficult.

Google can easy distinguish between genuine visitors and fake visitors. Hence, if your thinking to blast paid traffic to your channel, you might lose your Google account forever.

### Minimum views and traffic required to make money online

To earn decent money online, you must have a YouTube channel that gets 1000s of views daily or a site that receives 1000+ unique visitors per day from a developed country i.e. US, Europe, etc.

You can make few hundred dollars or more than that from a low-traffic through a niche blog.

**Conclusion**:  Blogging and Vlogging are two of the best methods to earn money online. To earn money, you should work hard on your YouTube channel or blog. There's no shortcut to success in this online world.
