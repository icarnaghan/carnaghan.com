NIDating is a free Northern Ireland Dating and matching personals service for local singles from Belfast to all other regions across the province. The site also caters to other singles throughout the rest of the UK and Ireland.<!--more-->

Northern Ireland Dating (nidating.com) is Northern Ireland's favourite personals site.  Carnaghan LLC has been working  on a complete site redesign incorporating the new Boonex Dolphin 7 content management system.  The software provides the most advanced services the site offered to date.  All areas of the site have been optimized including the existing media upload options for profiles, chat, messenger and forums.  Additional security options have been added so it is now easy for you to share or make private any aspect of your profile.

Other improvements include a new and more advanced member portal with easy to access menu items, and complete redesign of various member sections including new photograph and video galleries.  Our site design has been tweaked and enhanced for greater usability and accessibility.

Some areas are still in transition including the Help section, which will be completed in the weeks ahead.
