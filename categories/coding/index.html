My goal isn’t just to complete the course (we’ll see how far I actually get…), but really just to use it as a structured way to ramp up on Python again. Even though I’ve spent most of my career either as a software developer or technical lead, I haven’t done a ton of no-kidding, hands-on coding with Python directly. Most of my earlier coding experience has been with C#, JavaScript, some PHP and in recent years more of my day-to-day work has increasingly involved Python. While I consider myself at the intermediate level I decided to jump right in at the beginning of this course to make sure I’m not overlooking some important fundamentals.

This is a continuation of my previous notes about kubectl basics and focuses on practical commands and concepts I found useful when learning about scheduling.
What the Scheduler Does TLDR - the Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for deciding which node a pod should run on. Once a pod is created without a node assignment, the scheduler steps in and tries to find the most suitable node for it, based on resource availability, constraints, taints, and other factors.

When I first heard about Jamstack I was interested in finding ways I could leverage it for my own blog. When I first started I ended up managing the release and deployment of new content in a very manual way, making changes, running hugo to generate the static site, and then copying the output to a separate repository that served the site via GitHub Pages. While this workflow worked, it quickly became annoying and error-prone, especially when I forgot a step or made minor changes that didn’t get properly deployed.

This is my own quick-reference guide for working with kubectl, with just enough commentary to help it stick. If you’re interested in learning more I would recommend visiting the Official Kubernetes Documentation site, which covers everything you need.

The first impression of TypeScript for beginners is that it is a programming language, more or less, similar to JavaScript. Even professionals with enough coding experience often fail to define TypeScript. So how can we put the answer to this question - What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It has optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. TypeScript is not a separate programming language, what makes it different from JavaScript lies in part of its name - Type. Every programming language has data types, In JavaScript these include the commonly used number, string, boolean, etc. To understand TypeScript, we first need to understand how JavaScript behaves with its data types.

Objects could take the form of any aspect of a business application you are building. For example, if you needed to write an application that would be used as part of a school’s administration system you may include entities that represented objects such as teachers, students, courses, lessons, and so on. AppWorks provides a nice interface for managing these different types of entities and even lets you build relationships. The term entity modeling is not new to this platform, the concept behind this has been around for a long time, but it has traditionally been the responsibility of database engineers or software developers to define. The low-code platform AppWorks provides now enables business analysts to define these entities and relationships, without the need to have a software engineering background.

If you are interested in setting up AppWorks as a development environment, I highly recommend checking these out.

This can become even more confusing because JavaScript is a synchronous language with asynchronous capabilities. In order to understand asynchronous development in general, we need to start with the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. In simple terms, executing one task or item at a time is often referred to as synchronous, while executing multiple tasks (or threads) at a time is referred to as asynchronous.

It can accept and return values. The main purpose of using functions is for code reusability and organization. In JavaScript, functions can be considered ‘higher-order’. To better understand this term, we need to look at some basic concepts related to JavaScript functions.
Functions in JavaScript Take a look at the following code snippet:
function demo(){ console.log("This is a demo function") } demo() This is a very basic example of a JavaScript function. The name of the function is “demo” and its prints “This is a demo function!” in the console. We we can do a lot more with this function, including assigning it to a variable, or passing it to another function as a parameter. This is possible because JavaScript is a functional programming language.
