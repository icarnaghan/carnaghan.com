Loops help reduce redundant code and let you quickly offload repetitive tasks to the computer. In JavaScript there are several types of loops. In this lesson we are going to examine while, do while, and for loops.
While and Do While loops As their names suggest, while and do while loops carry out a number of tasks ‘while’ a certain condition is true. Take for example the need to display a series of numbers each incrementing by 1 until it we reach a certain limit (10). This could be carried out by writing the following code:

Since this time I’ve been slowly using more and more native JavaScript to get things done, so I thought it was time to revisit this concept using the fetch() API.
It has been very convenient over the years to use jQuery to simplify tasks that otherwise would have been more challenging to write in native JavaScript. Since ES6 has become pretty much mainstream nowadays, it is safe to take advantage of some of the features and benefits it brings.

In JavaScript, the criteria or condition is surrounded in parenthesis and the resulting code to run is contained in a block. Up until now, we have been examining single line statements. In JavaScript, a block of code is surrounded by curly braces. Let’s look at an example.

As you develop more complex code, you will come to rely on operators for performing the various functionally you are building. Before we dive into operators, let’s clear up a couple of fundamental programming terms, statements and expressions.
A statement is a line of code or action that consist of values, variables, and operators. In the last lesson you created several statements that assigned values to variables using the assignment = operator. Statements can set values but do not become values themselves. Statements end with a semi-colon. In contrast, an expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value, i.e. values, calculations resulting in other values, variables, and groups of variables.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript provides the interactive functionality commonly used throughout the web. In this lesson you will be introduced to some of the core concepts of JavaScript.
To follow along, you will need a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome or equivalent with developer tools. You will also need a capable text editor. I highly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The first concept we are going to cover in this lesson is variables. Variables are spaces of memory where you can store information of a certain type, that can be retrieved later in your code.

As someone who has worked in the software development field for a number of years, I have witnessed accounts of poor decision making and its ramifications within the organizations I have worked for. Specifically within software development I have witnessed poor decision making during proposal efforts, architectural decisions, and delivery.
Bidding on work, especially within the federal space, can be a time consuming and involved effort by many parties. On technical proposals, it is essential that the correct mix of people are part of the proposal team. I have observed how biases within the expedience domain can often come to play within business development. One project I was recently involved with in the last few years suffered from lack of technical input during the proposal phase, and availability and confirmation bias led the team to under bid the work. This had negative consequences on expectation of scope and delivery efforts later on. The situation could have been prevented by ensuring more technical expertise was placed within the team and those making the decisions affecting scope did an objective evidence.

One of the benefits of working at a large organization is the opportunity to work with a considerable number of very bright and talented individuals. Recently I went through a role transition from traditionally supporting web based content management systems to supporting large interconnected systems. I was fortunate to connect with a colleague during that transition time who was well versed on the latest technologies and approaches in software development, specifically with a focus on distributed systems and modern systems integration. This post highlights five main areas that are worth research and understanding if modern-day systems integration projects is something you might be involved with in your current work or in the near future. My disclaimer is that I am not an expert in any of these domains, however I want to pass along good material that I will be studying further and is hopefully of benefit to others.
