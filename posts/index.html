When I first heard about Jamstack I was interested in finding ways I could leverage it for my own blog. When I first started I ended up managing the release and deployment of new content in a very manual way, making changes, running hugo to generate the static site, and then copying the output to a separate repository that served the site via GitHub Pages. While this workflow worked, it quickly became annoying and error-prone, especially when I forgot a step or made minor changes that didn’t get properly deployed.

When you’re first diving into Kubernetes, the command-line tool kubectl becomes your new best friend.

This is my own quick-reference guide for working with kubectl, with just enough commentary to help it stick. If you’re interested in learning more I would recommend visiting the Official Kubernetes Documentation site, which covers everything you need.

It’s been close to a decade since the term ‘responsive’ became mainstream and changed our way of thinking about the structure of our applications across devices. Since that time other design philosophies have followed as we sought ways to improve the user experience across a diverse range of platforms. At the same time tools and techniques have continued to improve to arm designers with the right frameworks, libraries and approaches to deliver the best user experiences possible. In this article I will cover some of the more popular design approaches and libraries that can be used to implement them. I’ll conclude with a quick list of several wireframing tools that can also be used in design. I recommend checking out each of these resources via the links provided below.

The first impression of TypeScript for beginners is that it is a programming language, more or less, similar to JavaScript. Even professionals with enough coding experience often fail to define TypeScript. So how can we put the answer to this question - What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It has optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. TypeScript is not a separate programming language, what makes it different from JavaScript lies in part of its name - Type. Every programming language has data types, In JavaScript these include the commonly used number, string, boolean, etc. To understand TypeScript, we first need to understand how JavaScript behaves with its data types.

Objects could take the form of any aspect of a business application you are building. For example, if you needed to write an application that would be used as part of a school’s administration system you may include entities that represented objects such as teachers, students, courses, lessons, and so on. AppWorks provides a nice interface for managing these different types of entities and even lets you build relationships. The term entity modeling is not new to this platform, the concept behind this has been around for a long time, but it has traditionally been the responsibility of database engineers or software developers to define. The low-code platform AppWorks provides now enables business analysts to define these entities and relationships, without the need to have a software engineering background.

Fortunately, the modern age has added a new dimension to language learning and today’s learner has more tools at his disposal than ever before, all thanks to the Internet. But at the end of the day, it’s still the same old problem that you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. Learning a language still takes persistence and the willingness to learn, and unfortunately there is no tool yet invented to combat that, and I don’t think there ever will be, but the problem in successful language learning may lie in us purposefully choosing the most difficult path.

This can become even more confusing because JavaScript is a synchronous language with asynchronous capabilities. In order to understand asynchronous development in general, we need to start with the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. In simple terms, executing one task or item at a time is often referred to as synchronous, while executing multiple tasks (or threads) at a time is referred to as asynchronous.

It can accept and return values. The main purpose of using functions is for code reusability and organization. In JavaScript, functions can be considered ‘higher-order’. To better understand this term, we need to look at some basic concepts related to JavaScript functions.
Functions in JavaScript Take a look at the following code snippet:
function demo(){ console.log("This is a demo function") } demo() This is a very basic example of a JavaScript function. The name of the function is “demo” and its prints “This is a demo function!” in the console. We we can do a lot more with this function, including assigning it to a variable, or passing it to another function as a parameter. This is possible because JavaScript is a functional programming language.
